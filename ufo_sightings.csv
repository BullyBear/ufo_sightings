I noticed that there was a light off in the valley, it looked as if it could have been a big bonfire but I am still not sure exactly what it was, as there were some orb like lights seen there too (perhaps headlights).   As I was looking I saw a big white orb light appear from nowhere, above the trees, in the valley.  It was white and slowly floated and flickered out.  I saw no lights that indicated drones of any sort that I know of.  I went inside and asked the front desk clerk what was out that way, and she told me it was a residential type area she believed, but it is mostly surrounded by wilderness.   I decided to be curious and sit and watch for awhile, went up to my room and got my long lens dslr camera just in case.  I sat out on the porch of the hotel for a good 30 minutes, or so, and got some great footage of these lights swirling about in the trees.  They would slowly become bright, and take a path, then die out a bit.  When they are in two's, they would fly at each other.   They are not lanterns as they seem to form in the sky.  Mostly they were white, and would come one at at a time, but I also caught an instance of a white orb and an orange orb together.  Some orbs seemed to form together.  They would blink, but they do not seem to be the type of blink that you see on military or drone craft.   Also it being so late and actually dark, I would figure a drone light would stay on, rather than just flicker in and out.  The ones I caught on camera were closer in the valley, while the first one i saw was certainly in the sky.   My footage is taken at night, but it would be easy to cross check it with daylight footage to pinpoint where the lights were.  I would love to figure out what they are.  To me they seem like mountain lights such as the Brown Mountain lights in North Carolina, where I come from.",2015-08-06T00:00:00,61.537579245282984,POINT(-149.5421037735848 61.537579245282984),-149.5421037735848

While on a mule deer hunt, at approximately 0300, I woke due to digestive issues.  I started walking toward the bathroom which was located north of the truck I was sleeping in.  While walking, I looked up at the sky. The sky was overcast with altocumulus, turning into altostratus.  The moon was waning, about half full, which was located behind my travel of direction.  The clouds were not thick enough to block moonlight, which made the clouds very visible. While I looked up, I saw a blacked out disk silhouetted against the clouds, no lights, traveling at a high rate of speed from the NW, heading SE.  I estimated the speed at about 500MPH.  Similar to an F16 on a strafe run.  The objects altitude I guessed to be 1000ft above ground level.  After the object disappeared over the canyon rim, I looked for a follow up disk, which did not appear.  The object never made a sound. I proceeded along my way as if I saw nothing. Until now, I had completely forgot about the event.  This is what I find strange.  I am a former Meteorological Observer, trained by the US Military.  I have seen just about all military aircraft fly both in daylight and night.  This was not one of ours.

Filed by Melinda Leslie, Director of UFO Sighting Tours, Sedona. At approximately 10:00 p.m., or just before, my 6 clients and I (7 people total) were out on a UFO Sighting Tour with Military Night Vision Goggles when we all saw 2 large amber colored triangle shape objects with our naked eyes.  These traveled from the northwest area of the sky beyond Airport Mesa in a southward direction toward Cathedral Rock.  The 7 witnesses were standing together on Chavez Ranch Road turnout area.   The 2 objects then made an arching turn as they headed easterly toward the Chapel of the Holy Cross area and then disappeared to the North over Munds Mountain.   All witnesses were absolutely astonished and continued to discuss sighting event for duration of the tour. 4 of the witnesses clearly saw that these were 2 distinct structured, hard edged, dark triangle shaped craft each with 3 amber or orange colored lights on the bottom, one light at each corner.   Both craft were seen by the 4 witnesses with their naked eyes, without the Night Vision goggles.  2 other witnesses saw them at close range, but initially thru the goggles and could not make out the shape, only that they were huge lights.  One of these witnesses is a retired airline pilot with over 40 years of professional experience.  He stated emphatically that these 2 objects were remarkably faster than any plane he’d ever seen and that they were very low, much lower than commercial aircraft.  When these 2 witnesses lowered their goggles, they and I together saw that these were 2 very large amber colored lights, but unfortunately we did not see the distinct triangle shapes, each with 3 lights, as did my other 4 clients.  All 7 of us saw the 2 objects make an arched turn while banking and continued to watch them as they disappeared over Munds Mountain.  Please see the diagram below. Additionally, when these 2 craft were on initial approach, at the same time, a military jet at very high altitude passed over us and then another one did again as these 2 objects headed northeast.  All 7 witnesses commented that the 2 UFOs were considerably lower than either of the 2 jets.  It is difficult to judge the distance from us, but all the witnesses expressed that the UFOs were at most a few thousand feet, or less above us.  All 6 clients expressed that they are willing to be interviewed. Unfortunately we were so caught up in the event that none of us grabbed our cell phones to get a photo of the UFOs or take a video.

I walked out front of my house in Rocklin, California, around 2 am on Monday Morning, and I noticed a distant star like object that seemed to have a glowing tail.  At first I thought I believed it to be a star, but then I noticed it was wobbling and appeared to be falling.  It was glowing from red to blue, at which point I ran inside to get my mother and my nephew to make sure they saw the same thing I did.  They came outside and confirmed what I was looking at.  The star like object was wobbling back and forth while changing colors.  Then it appeared to throw tiny sparks out of the northern end.  We concentrated on this object for a while trying to figure out what it was.  Our perception led us to believe it was taking place in outer space because the physics are not possible due to earth’s gravity and atmosphere.  We knew it was not a star or a plane, we did not know what it was.  We were bewildered by what we were looking at and we started looking around the night s! ky at other stars. Then we saw something truly remarkable.  A large black object which had 3 bright lights shaped as a triangle with a red light in the middle, and it was hovering for a couple minutes directly north of us. We started to point at it, and were shocked and were not sure what we were looking at, then it started to move, and it flew directly over us. This object made little to no sound, which did not make sense considering how big the lights were, at that point we knew we were seeing something unexplainable. This object flew right over us, picking up speed until it moved behind a tree and then it was gone. The triangular object moved much faster than normal planes and helicopters. This object was almost silent and we are not sure the distance to the ground because the lights were huge and very bright. Once it passed the trees we lost track of the object. We focused our attention back to the original star like object. The star like object was still hovering and ch! anging colors while the triangular shaped object was gone. Abo! ut 1 min ute later we saw what seemed to be a helicopter that made a circle around the area we saw the triangular object. The helicopter was loud and had normal looking lights thus we believed it to be a helicopter. Also a few planes flew in that direction afterwards, again, they were loud and contained normal lighting, and the speed of the helicopter and planes were normal. The triangular object moved faster than both the helicopter and planes. The triangular object also was silent compared to the helicopter and planes that came next, (Almost like they were tracking this object) We believed the helicopters and planes were tracking this object because they flew in the same direction and made a circle around the star like object in the distance. We must have sat outside for 45 minutes at least trying to figure out what we saw. The Star like object in the distance was still hovering/and blinking which looked like it was falling. But did not actually fall, we watched the star like objec! t grow dim until it to was gone. At this point the night sky was silent again, we decided to go back inside our house, and none of us were sure what exactly we saw. The craziest thing was how big the lights were on the triangular craft like object, and the red light directly in the middle, we are still not sure what we saw. We cannot explain it.

It was just above the mountains.  It was not high in the sky and not too low. I was on my balcony looking towards the Santa Monica Mountains when I saw the glowing bright light rod appear.  It resembled a strange swirling corkscrew bolt of lightning, but it came out of nowhere.  It was bright!  It resembled a lightning bolt, but slightly different. It looked like the corkscrew motion was going towards the sky. It was a glowing. It has two distinct colors to the bolt. One part was a bluish white color and the other part was yellow. The colors were separate from one another, but were swirled together like different colored shoelaces. The bolt resembled a swirling portal. It was unbelievable. I've never ever seen anything like that. It was massive.  Just eye level in the sky and appeared out of nowhere, swirled towards the sky, then vanished.

If I had to guess the distance from my balcony to the object over the mountains, I would say it was 10 miles away directly in my viewpoint.  It was in the center horizon of the sky, eye level just above the mountains.  It appeared to be 3 feet in height vertically from where I was located, so it was huge!  It was the weirdest bolt of lightning that I ever witnessed. Sighting lasted 2-3 seconds at the most, but it seemed like a long time because I couldn't believe what I was witnessing.  It wasn't a craft, but it was definitely extraordinary.",2015-07-17T00:00:00,,,

First seen from the south, moving in a wide back and forth (meandering?) motion, ultimately disappearing in the east/north-east skies of the valley.   I thought it was a plane or helicopter at first, but it made no sound, had no blinking lights, and moved oddly for a craft carrying people.  It was too bright, and didn't fly in a motion similar to satellites or the ISS.  When directly overhead it appeared extremely high in the sky.  As it moved north-east of my position it headed towards a small, very high cloud formation that had that ""wind swept"" look to it and I expected it to go under the cloud.  Instead, it disappeared into the cloud and emerged a few moments later.  I lost view of the object soon after, due to the distance from my position.  The entire time it took to travel over the valley took about 15 minutes.

Lights remained for two to fifteen minutes in one spot, varying in brightness then typically moved off eastward and north toward the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains and brightness diminished until gone.  A few times the entity left in a more northerly direction, directly away, towards and above Aptos, growing faint to gone from view.   After the spot was left vacant for several minutes, another red light would appear faintly, and from our perspective, usually over Aptos (due north), and then grow in brightness as it came again to the same spot over the marine canyon and west of Moss Landing.   When we arrived at our coastal outlook on Del Monte Beach at 10:00pm, about 12-miles due south, we initially saw three entities hovered in an east-west line along the marine canyon, from 5 to 8 miles west of Moss Landing, at different heights, maybe 500 to 1500 feet above the water.   At first we thought they were mast lights on an historic ""tall ship,"" but they were too far away so the scale of the ship would have been huge.  Visual clarity was confusing with high clouds, but after several minutes, we could see there was no ship, just lights holding reasonably steadily, though not rigorously in place.   Though spaced apart a mile or less, when one began to relocate, the others moved in an apparent coordinated fashion.  One left and another would return and locate at the same spot over a 1.5 hour period, with one, two or three visible in collateral locations, of varying and changing brightnesses, at any time.  Or one would leave and the adjacent entity, already in view, would take its place.  The spot was occupied and vacated at least ten times.   Several aircraft were observed in the same direction but we could not determine if there was any interaction with the entities.  We could not make out any shape, yet the light generally appeared spherical.  At least once, while the entity was at its brightest, it appeared that a light was beamed downward at an angle, from the entity toward the ocean.  The beamed light was an extension - a ray - emanating from and connected to the spherical light entity, and tapering toward its end.  The length of the ray appeared to be three to four times the diameter of the entity at its brightest.  It appeared to reach at least half-way from the entity to the ocean surface, yet at our distance away this was uncertain.   At other times it appeared as though the ocean surface was being illuminated by a moving flood light in the immediate vicinity of the entity, yet the moving flood lights were faint and we were unsure that we actually saw this at our distance.  This were not as the beamed light noted prior, which was relatively spectacular.   We have no information of how long the entities were present before we arrived.

I had been sitting and talking with my friend who is a medical doctor at an area hospital.   There were a number of small aircraft flying around the area, which is typical around here on July 4th, but one aircraft really stood out.  Instead of the typical red and green blinking position lights as seen on the surrounding aircraft, this particular aircraft had one amber-orange light.

My wife and I saw what by all appearances was a UFO at Disneyland on the night of June 4th 2015.,Anaheim,CA,2015-06-04T22:45:00,oval,5-6 minutes,"Occurred : 6/4/2015 22:45  (Entered as : 6-4-15 22:45) Reported: 6/6/2015 2:35:49 PM 14:35 Posted: 6/15/2015 Location: Anaheim, CA Shape: Oval Duration:5-6 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/119/S119366.html,"My wife and I saw what by all appearances was a UFO at Disneyland on the night of June 4th 2015. My wife and I were at Disneyland on the night of June 4th 2015.  We were sitting on a low railing around a planter, waiting for the 11:00 pm light parade to start.  It was approximately 10:45 pm.  We were directly in front of the ""Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln"" building, facing west toward the circle that is the beginning of Main Street.  A man sitting to my right on the same railing got my attention by saying to me (while he was looking to the sky directly above the circle), ""Are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing, or am I going crazy?""   I followed his line of sight and observed what I at first glance appeared to be a giant dark smoke ring at cloud level (approximately 2000 feet).  I answered him, and said, ""No, you're not crazy I see it.""   I then said, ""What is that?""  He then said (as neither one of us took our eyes off of the object), ""I don't know, that's what I'm trying to figure out.""  At that time, my wife (sitting to my left on the same railing ) said to me what are you looking at, looked in the same direction and observed the same thing, she then asked me what it was. I told her I did not know.  Clearly this was not a smoke ring of any kind because by this time (by which a couple of minutes had passed), if it had been a smoke ring, it would have dissipated.   Upon further observation, this was an object partially obscured by being at just the bottom level of the cloud layer.  As if it were using the clouds to camouflage itself.  This object appeared to have a slight oval shape.  And I would approximate it to be (at being 2000 feet above us) about 300 yards long and 250 yards wide.  As we watched it began very slowly move due north (towards Cinderella's castle ).  I would estimate its speed at no more the 30 mph.  The object traveled a distance equivalent of about six times its length and slowly disappeared upwards at that point, the clouds around it envelopeing it until it was out of sight.   I remember as the object moved slowly through the clouds you could see the clouds billowing around the leading edge of the object.  It emitted no sound that I could detect and hid so well in the clouds that you could only see its dark silhouette, the front of the object having a darker appearance than the rest of the  silhouette, giving it an almost transparent appearance.  At about the same time the object started moving, my wife and I stood up and walked five feet forward to the curb of the street to get a better look at the object, and we remained there till it was gone from sight.  I did not get the other man's phone number as I should have, but after I acknowledged that I did see the object he showed no interest in talking about what we had seen, and when the parade was over, he walked away into the crowd of people.  So unless someone else happened to see this and comes forward with what they saw, it's just the corroboration of my wife and me, and we will not deny what we saw.   I did take photos of the object that are difficult to make out because you are looking at an object obscured by clouds at night.  Although in one of the shots you can make out the leading and trailing edges of the craft.",2015-06-15T00:00:00,33.83243273727664,POINT(-117.89132517193933 33.83243273727664),-117.89132517193933

I checked It with each eye and without binoculars several times to rule out eye or lens issues.

On July 26th, 2015, at approximately 18:30, my family witnessed an object in the sky which somewhat resembled a Ferris wheel.  The object was at a distance too high to see the dimensions, but the on and off brilliance was what first caught the eye of my oldest son who is 15.  I told him to keep his eye on the object while I ran to get my binoculars. Upon returning the object had moved very little, but was headed in a westerly direction towards the mountains.  Once I focused in on the object with my binoculars, it was a little difficult to stay steady with it because of the distance factor, however, I did have a few moments I could see the object clearly. The object appeared to be the shape of a disk and looked like a Ferris wheel because of the light pattern displayed with one bright light in the center with straight lines of light going to the perimeter of the object.  At the end of the straight lines of light on the perimeter, there were other points of light. The object was in a very slow tumble which varied from moment to moment.  Not like a ball rolling end-over-end, but fluidly changing its roll in different directions.  The lights were fading in and out almost at a constant rate; sometimes brighter and sometimes dimmer to the point it almost disappeared from sight.  I tried zeroing in on it with my cell phone camera, but the distance was too great.  No sound.  The object slowly moved further away in a westerly direction until it was out of sight.  Total viewing time was approximately 4 minutes.  The object did not make any noticeable sound.

I am an experienced hiker/backpacker having spent more than 250 days out in the last ten years. On 6/26/93 I was back packing alone in Holy Cross Wilderness area. I had set up camp just at tree line in some scrub brush near a rocky clearing approximately 2 miles due north of Mt Holy Cross.  After securing food and smellables I retired to my tent.  I was awakened to the sound of ""animals?"" scratching the gravel and sand around the tent.  I was not concerned as it sounded like muscrats.. and I quickly fell back asleep. Sometime later I woke abruptly in a cold sweat unable to move or to hear anything (as though underwater).  I was able to open my eyes.  As I did this the sound began to come back but as though through a wall or from far away.  I was scared but thought it a bad dream.  As I lay not knowing what was happening the wind began to pick up and the tent seemed to billow and fall, as though breathing.  The sounds that had been outside previously, had returned and began to intensify.  Instead of one or two small animals though it was as if there were a dozen angrily digging/scratching at the ground all around the tent.  Still unable to move to look from side to side (I was lying on my back) I heard the scratching move from the ground to the tent walls on all sides.  As this happened the wind became more intense causing the tent to sway.  I suppose all of this could be explained by my having a bad dream and a wind storm coming up suddenly.  However, the next part I can not explain.  This whole wind/scratching/tent moving lasted for about 15 to 20 minutes.  Then as though someone had blown out a candle everything stopped and there was complete stillness.  Then the whole tent and surroundings became brighter than daylight.  A complete and encompasing white light entered the tent.  I was absolutely blinding.  I was still unable to move.  I light moved around in some ways but was always intense.  Then as quickly as it became bright it was again dark and as still as any quiet night in the woods.  There wa! s no mor e wind and no more scratching.  As soon as the light was gone I was able to move again.  Needless to say I was upset.  Checking my watch it was almost 03:30:00.  I got up and packed up my things and began my assent of Holy Cross Mtn two hours early.   I did not pass by my campsite on my way out of the preserve.  Rather I took an extended loop and spent the next three nights wondering if it would happen again.  It did not.  I did not see any other hikers during my 5 day outing.  After I left the wilderness area I drove to the nearest town to get some supplies and see if any one had reported any strange sightings.  No one else had seen or reported anything.  I do not do drugs and was not influenced by alcohol during this trip.  I did not see a craft or see any ""little green men""  but I can not explain what happened to me that night.  All I know is that it scared the crap out of me and I am not one to get scared in the woods.",2001-01-03T00:00:00,,,

This family of four were driving home and at approximately 8:45 both husband and wife saw a bright orange colored object in the Western sky.  One could make the argument that what they were viewing was Venus; however they claim that the object was moving Erratically in a zig zag pattern.   Additionally their intuition was telling them something was off.   After about 10 minutes of viewing they stated that the object disappeared into thin air.   To try and debunk the picture of the object, I took a picture of Venus to compare.  In my opinion, there is no comparison.  The picture of the object seemed much closer, more brilliant in color and seemed for cylindrical in shape.  Whatever they saw has forever changed their view of what could be out there.

We live near tampa and Clearwater airport and see a lot of air traffic, including helicopters, and are used to all types of aircraft sounds. This was flying too low and made no sound whatsoever.

These lights were more or less in a line stretching  about a fourth of the way across the sky as I watched them slowly move southward.  They were not tightly spaced but had about same space between them: K One........Two.......Three/ Four (these two were one above the other with roughly the same ....... spacing, and seemed to be trying to get closer to each other) then........Five. They must have not been that far away from me because they were quite bright and bigger than stars. I don't know where they came from I just saw them there in that line slowly moving north. At a certain point (which oddly corresponds to where the visibility from my vantage point is unobstructed when  looking at that part of the sky), the light of first object suddenly went dark, and after that when each of those objects reached that part of the sky they too sent dark. It seems that they may have continued on but moving east now ( but I could not be certain).This sighting occurred in Tampa, but in the Temple Terrace/Thontosassa area. These objects moved slowly, and I estimate I watched this for at least three minutes. I wondered if anyone else saw them? As watched it felt almost like they were putting on a show just for me as it took so long. I looked on-line, and it may be possible they were some sort of sky lanterns ( Chinese lanterns) as they are that color and move slowly. I can't be certain. I did not hear of any being launched. But it is a possibility. I always look up at the night sky and have never seen anything like what I saw ever before. However, there was a night  in the  summer  of 2009 in which I saw on roughly that same area of the sky  where the lights went off  in last nights sighting; a strangely churning white cloud ( at night).  I remember because I have NEVER seen a cloud churn and billow so fast.  On that night I got a chill because I was driving home listening to a man tell a story about Moses and the cloud appearing in the mountain, when, as I pulled into my driveway, I saw this strangely churning cloud directly in my line of vision.  It was late at night also and the synchronicity of what I saw  and heard made me run for cover inside my house. So for me, I guess,  that area of sky is indeed mysterious.  I softened wondered if behind that churning cloud was a mother ship.

At the time we were your typical high school students, full of energy and ready to tackle life. It happened when we were out on his back deck.  We were rather bored, and it was beautiful night, the stars were shining very bright and as we lived in a rural area away from any major cities we could see them more than most people. It started when I was stargazing out on the deck, and happened to notice an equilateral triangle in the sky (composed of lights).  As I had never noticed any perfect triangular constellations it really peaked my curiosity.  I maintained gaze on this figure for quite some time and I realized that it was moving. It was moving back and forth in ways that a normal aircraft wouldn't, left to right and up and down, repeating the same motions.  I eventually signaled to my friend ((male name deleted)) that I thought I saw something weird and asked him if he could see it too.  He said he did. At this point the triangular shape started to descend, or I assume it did as the equilateral points of the triangle began to spread out very slowly.

((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the sighting was of a re-entering Russian satellite.  See comment, submitted by Mr. Ted Molczan, satellite tracker, that appears at the end of the report below.  PD)) On 28 June, 2015, at about 5pm my family and I departed from Richmond Hill, GA, on our long road trip to Colorado Springs, CO, where I will be stationed as an active duty Army senior NCO.   Prior to leaving I bought a brand new GPS navigation unit and we tested it out in town prior to our trip knowing it worked well.  Our navigation unit directed us toward Augusta, GA.  Our kids fell asleep at about 9pm. At precisely 01:28am 29 June 2015 on HWY 1 south heading north approximately 7-8 miles south of a gas station at 10525 HWY 1 south, Wadley, GA, 30477.  Our radio began to get real static so I turned it down when my wife noticed a very large object flying left to right coming toward us.  I looked up to the left and hit my brakes stopping our truck to the side of the road.  The object appeared to be approximately 250 meters in length 60 meters height and was approximately flying 200 feet in altitude and was spurting sparks from the rear of the object.  The sparks were jetting out about 50-80 meters in a pattern of controlling thrust. My wife and I had a very good look at the object closer than anyone else on that highway considering there was no vehicles in sight.  The object had a dim glow of a orange around it, vague but noticeable.  The objects exterior was metallic but appeared to look like oil on water effect to it and appeared to be fluid like movement over the metallic body of the object.   My wife and I watched in disbelief in what we were witnessing as it moved left to right the object decreased in altitude as it was over the highway then began to increase in altitude after it crossed the highway right overhead of us.  We watched as it increased in altitude and penetrated some clouds and accelerated out of sight through the cloud cover quickly. I got back on the road and processed down the highway way feeling a bit shook up with a mild headache trying debunk what it might have been.  Too fast for a blimp, too slow for airplanes, no sound but mild humming, too big to be any aircraft or helicopter, and so on.   About 4-5 miles further up the road a semi truck had stopped on the side of the road on the southbound lanes and a car with a guy getting back in their car as they saw what we saw.  I stopped at the first gas station on the right and told the guy there what we saw and bought a few things to proceed on our road trip.  An hour later our navigation system malfunctioned telling us we were at our final destination in the middle of nowhere at a church.  My wife mentioned that we have been driving 9 hours which steamed to me to be a long time for the amount distance we cover.  I stopped and powered it down and reset it to Colorado Springs.  We got back on track and we stopped to sleep in north Atlanta area just after 6am. My stomach was upset and I did not sleep well nor did my wife. We got up late afternoon and got back on the road. 6 hours after being on the road my trucks transmission began acting up and we had stopped.  I messed around with changing my truck's transmission settings through all the functions for about 15 minutes and it eventually corrected itself.  I have had on an off headaches and upset stomach since witnessing this object.  My truck has been acting odd as well, check engine oil level, check engine, and a large chip in the windshield not noticed before. I have receipts and time lines. I am capable of drawing and painting a visual representation of what we saw but my art supplies are packed away until we find a home to buy so I’m limited as to what I can do for the time being.  The image of that object is vivid in my mind to good detail so I will have produce a visual reference at a later time. Please keep in mind I am active duty military.  I’m speaking of this only because I have not yet been told not to and forced to sign non disclosure orders as I have been forced to in the past.  My MOS has  presented me with more than a few of incidents in similar situations.  I have always had been approached and forced to sign the nondisclosure orders.  If you need anything else someone needs to get here and talk to me soon. Thanks! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite objective and serious-minded.  We wonder whether he and his family might have been witness to the re-entering satellite, reported for the same time and date over the Midwest and East Coast.  However, in a second conversation, the witness states unambiguously that he believes that what he witnessed with his family was not a re-entering satellite.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM MR. TED MOLCZAN, SATELLITE TRACKER)) Hello Peter, I received the meteor camera data this morning.  A quick review indicates that the re-entry passed roughly 3 to 4 min. earlier than I had estimated from the orbital data.  This reduces the discrepancy between the reported time of the sighting and re-entry to about 1 to 2 min.  Taking into account the Earth's rotation relative the trajectory, the earlier passage shifted the track closer to the witness, resulting in roughly a 10 to 15 deg higher elevation above the horizon than in my earlier estimate.  Therefore, their view of the event was even better than my earlier estimate. I hope to complete a more thorough analysis of the meteor data in the coming weeks, but I do not expect the results to materially affect my finding that the re-entry is the most probable cause of the UFO sighting.

I was on Delta Airlines Flight 1667 flying from Atlanta, GA, to Myrtle Beach, S.C.  The aircraft was a MD-88 and I was sitting in seat 19E on the starboard side of the aircraft, several rows forward of the wing, which I could see on the right side of my window when I leaned forward.  We took off an hour late at around 22:29.  There was an overcast of Cirrus-stratus or Alto-stratus clouds.  The full moon was not visible through this layer.  There were no lower clouds and city lights were plainly visible without obstruction during the initial climb out after takeoff.  There were no reading lights in use near me.  There were also no electronics in use with illuminated screens nearby that would have reflected on the inside of the window. Shortly after takeoff the aircraft leveled out and the lights of the city were plainly visible with a definite darker area extending out to the horizon visible under a slightly lighter sky over that.   At this point I was looking down at the city lights, when I noticed a light separate itself from the rest and begin to move.  It was a banana yellow color and was moving upward at a slow and steady pace.  There were no other details to it.  I could not judge its distance from us.   As it moved, it appeared to be heading on an opposite course to ours and was climbing at an angle of approximately forty five degrees.  From my perspective it moved from the lower left of the window to its upper right corner where I lost it to view.   The light became obscured by the leading edge of the wing and then reappeared over the rear upper edge of the wing or wingtip.  All this time which was probably a minute or so the light did not change in brightness or flicker.  The color stayed the sa! me and so did its speed of ascent.  I was unable to observe the object further as it went out of my limited field of view even by shifting my position. I don't know if anyone else on the aircraft saw this.  There was no apparent reaction. The young man sitting next to me on the left was listening to music and not looking out the window.  This whole thing occurred to quickly to try to get anyone's attention. During the initial takeoff before we leveled out there were other aircraft visible.  This light or object did not exhibit their characteristics.  I have flown numerous times at night and have seen plenty of aircraft leaving or arriving at airports.  This was not one of them. Its apparent point of origin was not from any airport. It was an urban environment.  Shortly after this we began to ascend again and banked for a course change.  I checked my watch and it was now 22:35. I am sixty two years old, male, and was travelling alone returning home from a family related trip.  I am a retired social worker and business manager.

Walked ver to take a look and was shocked to see appoximately 5 to six of these bright lights lined up across the ocean from left to right.   Looked like they were hovering in place.  Looked like there was about at least 30 ft between each one.  Tried to get my husband to get out of bed and come and look at them but he wouldn't.  It was creepy to see.

(Until I had this experience and went online to research where to report it, I had no idea that there have been so many UFO sightings, especially on the 4th of July of each year.)    After watching the city fireworks from our back balcony, I noticed a bright red, round light floating from east to west,across the southern sky.  It had no sound, and at first I wondered if I was seeing a satellite.   But it was a bright red, bigger and brighter light than a satellite, and it looked to be be much closer.  Its light intensity seemed to get a bit brighter and dimmer alternately, but still remained a bright red.  It looked like it was at the altitude that a low-flying plane would be coming in to land, but it floated levelly and had no small navigational red or white blinking lights on it, like planes do.  (We have planes frequently flying over our home, heading to the local airport for landings, and this appeared very different than those.)   As it passed by our house, it finally seemed to turn ""outward"", (away from us and the earth), and it quickly just faded away and was gone. The whole incident took approximately 15 seconds, but seemed much longer. As I was trying to make sense of what I had just witnessed, I noticed another red, round light to the left (east) of the first one, in the same area that we'd watched the fireworks just 10 minutes prior.  This red light was the same shape, color and intensity as the first one.  It hovered briefly rather high in the sky, then just descended, going straight down, towards land.  It went behind the treeline, whereby I couldn't see it any longer.   This whole incident also took approximately 15 seconds.  Like the first one, this light had no additional navigational lights like planes do.  It was silent, and seemed to have a smooth, ""floating"" quality to it. I was so baffled and almost flabbergasted by the sight of these two objects, that I did not even think to try to take a photograph.  I was in this kind of momentary ""time warp,"" where I was just awestruck by the whole experience--not really understanding or knowing for sure what I had actually just witnessed. I have never before witnessed this type of phenomenon, nor have I been a person who has an unusual interest or intrigue with UFO's.

It was a very clear night. It did not appear to be a plane since there was no flashing lights, noise or trail and did not have the movement of a plane as I will explain in detail. I ruled out a satellite or the ISS for the following reasons. I observed the ISS at much lower elevations above the horizon, traveling in a strait path at a consistant speed and following a NW to SE orbit. this was nothing like that.  It was not a satellite or ISS because:  1.  The object was not traveling at a constant speed.  It seemed to slow down then speed up constantly as it moved across the sky   2.  At times the object seemed to wiggle or meander at times in a sense  that it shifted it's course slightly while moving very slowly then speed up again. We noticed this several times. 3.  As it moved east the light did not seem to dim as a satellite or the ISS would from loosing the reflection of the sun on the solar panels.  To me this indicated the glow of the light was powered by the object and not reflected from the sun.  4. The object was about the size as one would observe Venus but not quite as bright but more yellow/orange in color. The object was visible at that intensity for several minutes.

I then began to see what at first I thought was a aircraft at a lower altitude, coming from the SW into view and was orange glowing which I thought was its landing lights.  We have a small grassy airstrip nearby. After it got closer, I was thinking it should be making some sort of noise which it was not.  It see to have a similar speed to a helicopter then a airplane.

Then they all proceeded to fly the same path east, then southeast, and gained altitude and faded one by one.

Too much energy would be required to launch, reach altitude and power a sufficiently bright light that could be seen maybe ½ mile away.  Were they drones?   After burn-out, there was no sign that they fell to earth. Local SWAT drones?  DARPA? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

On the evening of July 3rd, 2015, around 9:50 PM, a friend and I had a sighted something that neither of us can explain.  We went to watch the fireworks at the local high school in Niles, IL.  We went to the 3rd story of a parking garage for a better view of the fireworks with a number of other patrons.  We were about 300 yards away from the firework display, and randomly noticed 2 green lights with a single white flashing light on the object that we could not physically see outside of the light display.  We had found it curious, as it seemed to literally be spectating the fireworks while hovering/sitting over the show.  My friend and I actually went into debate as to whether it was a UFO or a helicopter.  I originally put it off as a helicopter, because generally speaking, that's what sane people believe. It started to catch our attention more as the green lights both turned red.  It was unlike any normal aircraft that we could think of.  Obviously, since it was sitting over the fireworks, it could not be a plane.  And usually the lights displayed on a helicopter stay consistent and do not change at random. What happened next is what truly makes me believe that we saw a UFO.  It went from sitting in one place to my friend and I watching it dart across the sky directly east of where we were stationed.  It quickly changed direction and again, changed color from green to red, and turned from left to right.  Again, it changed to green as it looked to fly into the tree line about 5 miles away.  I did record the event as soon as it started flying away because of how much it intrigued me.  With that being said, I recorded a 29 second video of the occurrence.  We have seen a number of planes tonight since the incident, and this object was going at a much quicker pace, and moved extremely quickly while changing direction unlike any flying object I have ever seen.  In addition, even with the random increase of speed, you did not hear a single sound, which would be assumed by an object moving at that speed.",2015-07-06T00:00:00,42.030999999999956,POINT(-87.81120000000008 42.030999999999956),-87.81120000000008

Okay, have never seen anything odd/ufo-like until tonight.  I even got video because I’d been taking shots of the nearly full red moon.  Was only doing that because I’d been taking pics of fireworks going off in the area and noticed the moon.   Suddenly, I noticed this red/orange ball of light that was tracking across the sky sort of my direction and came from my line of sight to the moon.  Thought at first it would just die out as being the end of a firework.  Nope.  It stayed steady at first in its travel, although it seemed to be spinning.   I then thought maybe I’m seeing my first drone.  But the more I watched it literally seemed like fire causing the light, and yet I didn’t think a lantern would travel like this.  My eyes aren’t great, so I just filmed it come closer, not exactly going the same speed or evenly and then fly overhead past the overhang on my balcony… then I went back to taking pics of the moon. Maybe 2 minutes later (of course I had the camera put down by then), the sucker is back, traveling basically the exact same route.  Only I didn’t see how it GOT there.  Did not see it circle back around.  I was only able to capture some of the 2nd sighting on video. Was curious to see what I’d filmed, so instantly downloaded it to the computer.  Now, my camera takes excellent shots and the ones of the moon were a great example.  It wasn’t that large in the sky and yet I’m able to get the craters, all the features (and oddly, some other lights near the moon which I also couldn’t explain because they changed frame to frame and I don’t think satellites move that fast).   Anyway, the fireball was definitely fire inside.  It appeared to be inside something and that something would rotate end over end and or sideways.  I captured the texture of the outside and its freaking weird.  The word ‘blob’ comes to mind, but there were kind of like puffy layers to it and I strongly believe the fire part only came out of one end, which had sort of a torn appearance.   From the movement, no way was it a lantern or it would’ve caught fire and gone down quickly – certainly wouldn’t have returned either.  From the video I feel like I saw something that belonged in the ocean, except it was fire-propelled and in the sky for anyone to see.",2015-07-06T00:00:00,41.804399999999994,POINT(-88.34699999999997 41.804399999999994),-88.34699999999997

I was standing and looking directly eastward and about a quarter of a mile away and (from my perception) about 20-40 feet above a treeline, I saw an extremely large shape in the sky, very sharply pointed in the middle, which I saw first, and extremely wide and long in its width, which all of a sudden just seemed to slowly appear.  It almost reminded me of a large bulky arrowhead in the width, but the sharply pointed center looked like the two sides of a triangle. In the middle of it, above the largely pointed center, was a round shape that looked almost dome-like or conical.  I could not see the length of it as I was looking directly at it as it was heading west, and just could see the front and width of it.  Perhaps the craft was just super wide and not long in length at all, which is possibly why I did not see its length.  It was moving slowly, not fast at all.  The middle portion (triangle dome-like center) looked a bit lighter than the rest of the craft.   As I continued to stare at it – pretty much frozen and afraid to blink - I then saw what looked like a hot sidewalk effect, for lack of a better description, or a waviness slowly forming around this thing, and then it looked as though piece by piece I could see through it until it faded or melted into the sky, almost as though it was camouflaging itself in the night sky.  If I hadn’t been looking in that exact direction at the moment I did, I would have missed it, despite it being so large, because of the way it sort of fit in with the sky.   As it got a little closer, I noticed light from underneath it but then I also noticed that it faded into the sky more and the shape became sort of lost or not as discernible as it had been.  What did become more discernible, though, were the lights.  By the time it was nearing my home, I saw one larg! e circle with about 15-20 red globes of light within the circle.  I sensed that the lights were underneath something, but the object was not discernible around or over the lights at this point.  Everything looked just really dark.  But I knew it was there and I sensed it was there.  The lights seemed low, perhaps 500-600 feet.  It was silent.  The circle of lights then moved very slightly in a northwesternly direction over my house.   At this point, I became afraid and grabbed my dog.  I ran from the back door through my house to the front window as it faces north, to see if I could follow it, but when I looked at my front window it had disappeared.  It was just gone.  I did not go back outside. It is difficult to judge by measurement the size of what I saw without using the words huge or large.  If I stand in the same spot where I was standing when I initially saw it above the treeline about a quarter of a mile away and hold up a quarter at arm’s length, then I would have to hold perhaps 3-4 quarters across to cover the width of it at that distance when I saw it first appear in the sky. I live fairly close to an airport (about 30 minutes south) and am very familiar with the sights and sounds of airplanes, whether they are flying high or low, daytime or nighttime, but this was not like anything I had ever seen before.  It didn’t make one sound, and was large.  There are always planes flying in their flight paths over my neighborhood, but strangely enough, there wasn’t one plane in sight during that time or that I could hear.  Just silence. My husband and son weren’t home at the time, and I did not have my cell phone on me when this occurred as I was just letting the dog out and had left it in the house, never thinking this would be happening, so unfortunately, I can only tell you what I saw with my own eyes. After telling my husband and son about my experience, they showed me pictures of a stealth bomber, but it did not resemble what I saw.  They also showed me pictures of Chinese lanterns, but again, the lights that I saw did not resemble Chinese lanterns. This was such an unnerving experience for me.

We were enjoying our viewing and my oldest daughter asked to go home to get her telescope.  We did, and by the time we got back out there, the view was not quite as good as it had been.  There were a lot of mosquitos, so I told the girls to get back in to the car.  I had set the telescope on my trunk and was trying to get the moon in to focus.  The telescope wasn't of high quality, and I got frustrated that I couldn't maintain decent focus. On our return trip home, my youngest said ""OOH!  Look at those planes!""  I looked over and saw nothing.  My oldest had similar results.  The youngest said ""Geeze, you guys, they are right there!"".  I leaned over and looked and there were not three planes, but one solid craft approaching us at a relatively slow pace on our right side.  I pulled over and it passed us.  Immediately, I rolled down my windows.  It was dead silent outside, save for the sound of crickets and frogs.  Both girls got kind of freaked out due to the fact that they are no strangers to air shows and know what jets sound like.

Around 10:20 pm on the night of 7/21/15, my friend and I were sitting on the back porch stargazing when we encountered a very slow, low-flying craft coming from the east.  We live in a fairly close proximity to a National Guard bombing range so we've seen our fair share of strange planes and all manner of aircraft, but this was by far the most interesting and unique encounter we've had to date. The craft was triangular in shape, with a single white light on each corner and a blinking red light on the middle of the underside.  What really struck us about the object is that it was flying incredibly low, much lower than other aircraft we've seen during military flyovers, and of course much, MUCH lower than any commercial airplanes that regularly fly overhead.   The second striking feature was the speed at which the object was moving--it was easily the slowest moving craft to ever fly overhead (and that's really saying something in A10 and AC130 territory!)  It took approximately ten minutes to completely disappear from our line of sight. The thing that seemed to differ from other reports that we've read since our encounter last night was the noise level.  While others seem to describe similar encounters as quiet or silent, our craft was quite loud, emitting a low rumble that could be heard even after it was out of our sight. As an interesting side note, shortly after that experience, we saw on the local news that a Blackhawk helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing at a relatively local airport--connected?  In any case, the craft is welcome to fly by any time it wants, it was a wonderful experience.",2015-07-23T00:00:00,,,

My dad related this story many times over the years. I will relay it as accurately as possible. In 1970  Dad was a city police officer in the small town in southeastern, Ky.  He was on duty one night when he received a radio call from the only other officer on duty to meet.  The other officer was patrolling the other side of town. They subsequently met and the other officer told my father that he was very tired, and didn’t think he could stay awake any longer.  Dad told him to go get a nap and he would cover his patrol.  He told him to go to what at the time was an open field just outside town. He told the other officer to head that way and he would follow him to make sure he found the place and made it ok. While following him in his own patrol car, they both noticed a bright light appear in the sky ahead of them.  It grew steadily brighter and it became clear that it was heading toward them.  Dad yelled over the radio, “It’s going to hit you!”  He said he was sure it was going to take the lights off his partner’s car, however it just missed.  The object flew over behind a line of trees and landed.  All this time, they were talking back and forth over the radio. They stopped, got out and begin to approach the object.  My father told many times how frightening this was, and how when his partner drew his weapon he was shaking so bad he could hear the bullets rattle in the cylinder.  Dad told him to put it away before he let it off and hurt one of them, and that it would most likely be of no use. They approached within 35-40 yards of the object.  It was sitting flush on the ground.  There was no apparent landing gear.  It was discus (Olympic) shaped, about 25-30 feet wide, and 15 feet or so thick at the center.  It made no sound.  It omitted mostly white light from the entire object very much like a fluorescent light bulb, however there were different colors swirling within.  They were about to try to get closer when it lifted up completely silently above the tree tops, paused for moment and then took off in a flash straight up and out of sight. They decided not to make a formal report out of fear they would not be believed and be ridiculed. He said the “strangest” part of the entire incident was while they were talking car to car when they first sighted the object, dispatch never heard any of it, and in fact wanted to know why neither of them had been responding.

They were flying in a straight line, left to right across my direction of travel, and consisted of two silver cylindrical objects that I would guess were about the size of railroad tank cars but taller and maybe longer, and were ahead of a third object that was black, and square or rectangular in shape, and as large as the cylinders. I saw no windows on any of the objects, nor any means of propulsion - no wings or propellers - and no discernible tail features.  There was no sign of any smoke or other exhaust features. They were moving relatively slowly, and stayed in view for about 40 seconds before I drove past the point where they were off my right side and out of my sight.  If they stayed on that course, they would have passed over the Germantown area. I was in heavy morning rush hour traffic, in the center lane, and could not pull over to either side to stop for a better view. I don't know for sure what they were, and, unless we have technology that I am not aware of, I seriously doubt that they were made by man - homo sapiens. All of my life, I have believed that we are not alone.  Now, unless this can be explained away, I am very sure we are NOT alone! ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Mr. Davenport, I did report it to another site, but they never published anything on it.  I just found out about your site due to an article in the newspaper (Frederick, MD News Post).  Thank you for taking interest in it. And, yes, it WAS a dramatic sighting!  I was in heavy rush hour traffic in the middle lane of 3.  They were flying just above treetop level.  The driver in the car to my left obviously saw it also, but the look on his face was absolute terror.  I seriously doubt he told anyone about it.  I did confide in a few friends - almost sorry I did.  I don't think any of them believe me.  I only wish I could have gotten to my phone to use the camera in it.  I have ordered a dash cam, just to make sure something like this never happens - undocumented - again.     I couldn't stop to get a better view either, due to the traffic.  I even had a policeman in our church check to see if there were any other sightings.  The only thing he could tell me was, ""Yes, there were."" I was not frightened by it.  But, I must admit, I have lost a few nights sleep wondering who/what they were, where were they from, what were they doing here - so many questions I would like to ask them if I had the opportunity.  I wouldn't mind taking a ride in a ufo either, assuming I could come back from it! The cylinders were so large, I have wondered if it could have been the beginning of an invasion.  My guess is each of the 2 cylinders could easily have accommodated 2-300 or more human sized troops.  I would also guess the 3rd craft was a control unit. As I drove down the road after the sighting, a big black helicopter flew past me headed in the direction I had seen the objects going. Interesting!!

I had just gotten home from school when I threw down my backpack and did my usual thing as a kid by running outside to play kickball.  I lived a stone's throw from the Edgewood Arsenal in Edgewood, Maryland so I was familiar with their routine paratrooper drops and helicopter activity around that area.  It was a sunny, beautiful day with bright blue skies and cottonball-like, low cumulus clouds.  I was standing on my front porch about to run over to play with friends when a bright reflective-like flash caught my attention.  I looked (east?) over the railroad tracks and saw a chrome-colored ball just sitting in the air.  I would guesstimate that it was approximatly 500-750 feet above ground.  I remember freezing in complete silence as I immediately knew that I was observing something peculiar.  I would best describe it as a ball bearing that was highly reflective, probably 30 to 40 feet in diameter.  I remember standing as still as I possibly could, because even as a kid I must admit that I was intrigued by UFOs.  I remember thinking, ""oh my God, just be still and watch it and don't blink your eyes!!"" My parents were not home as my mother got back from work usually and hour after me, so I couldn't call for anyone.  I'm sure that if someone else had been outside nearby I would have called for them to look at it with me, but strangely nobody was outside in earshot.  The object stayed completely still for approximately 30 seconds.  I remember thinking maybe it was a balloon or a Radiosonde, because I had found one of those in a nearby patch of woods years prior. I remember feeling almost paralyzed with an anxiety-like fear.  I knew I was seeing something I wasn't supposed to.  It's almost as if my body reacted to it also.  After remaining still, the object began to move laterally, from right to left.  It was almost like it was being pulled sideways on a string.  That made me even more scared because balloons usually drift up, ya know?  As it was moving to the left, it stopped,(like putting on the brakes)an! d slowly moved back to the right, and then I had this weird feeling that it knew I was watching it beacuse it changed direction again and disappeared behind a thick cloud.  I kept watching and the strangest thing happened.  I continued staring at the cloud in hopes of seeing it come out the other side, but it seemed to poke out barely from the right edge of the cloud, almost as if it were peeking to see if I was still there watching. I got the feeling that it knew I was there. (Weird!) I continued watching to see if it would come back out but it never did. The whole episode was probably less than a minute in duration. The object never moved up or down, just perfectly sideways. I never told my parents because they wouldn't have believed me anyway. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Location was east of Munising, and north of Shingleton, in the north central Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  Duration was approximately 7 minutes. At about 10 pm Eastern I went outside in an open area with my two dogs to watch the full moon rise in the east above the spruce trees in the distance.  As I turned to the north I was startled to see a surprisingly bright object flashing extremely brilliant red and white lights.  The lights were much, much larger than any star, a satellite, or the lights of an aircraft, so much so that my mouth literally dropped.  It was approaching me, silently, and gave me the impression of slowly floating. I have no knowledge of the altitude. I will describe the red color as attractive, pleasing, not fire-engine red nor candy-apple red, a cool-ish red but not pink. The red color was more dominant than the white lights. As I watched it drift closer, I was stunned at how beautiful it was and I was riveted looking at it.  My Sheltie at my side did not agree.  She barked at the bright lights and then she and my Border Collie ran for the door, wanting to be let inside.  I was wearing on my forehead a Petzl headlamp on the highest beam and I decided to switch it off. The object gently turned in a southeastern direction, still gliding silently.  I had my little palm-sized Fuji camera with me (since I had planned to take some pictures of baby toads) so I attempted to take a short video of the object as it moved southeasterly.  I saw there was a faint, quite dim, white light following the red-white flashing object.  If I were to hold my hand straight out, the distance between the red-white object and the following white light would be about one of my hands across. As I was watching it, somebody suddenly ""turned out the lights""--and it was gone!  The dim light that had been following I could see for another 3 or 4 seconds, until it too disappeared. The geography the object had to have come from is Lake Superior and then over wilderness northern forest with very little to no population.  My sad attempt at a video turned out to show only a difficult-to-see, pin-point, red flashing light, so like others I have viewed on YouTube. I will add that I took a college course in astronomy years ago and I enjoy the night sky, so I am not a stranger to planets and constellations, various satellites, Iridium satellite flares, nighttime aircraft, and so forth.  This experience was unique. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF ORIGINAL REPORT)) If I may, I would like to add some information to my report of August 1, 2015.  I did not originally write it into my experience thinking it was too fantastic to be believed and also leaving out my personal feelings at the sighting.  But it has bothered me consistently since.  If you judge the following to be important facts, please do include it in my report, editing however you consider best.  I apologize for adding inconvenience to your already heavy workload.   My report was submitted, and has been posted, as:   8/1/15 22:00	North Central Upper Peninsula	MI	Light	7 minutes 	Intensely bright, red-and-white flashing, silent, slowly moving object.   The object appeared to be composed of multiple splendid glittering, shimmering lights cascading and independently moving, which also gave it a vertical oval shape.  None of the lights fell to the ground.   My distinct impression was that its intent was to be noticed (and how could anyone not?).  I clicked off my Petzl light because I myself wanted to avoid being noticed. ((END ADDENDUM))",2015-08-06T00:00:00,,,

I was facing east as most of the fireworks were going off that way, but some were also being set off to the south, as well as to the north of my spot. At one point I noticed several reddish orange lights that were moving to the east-southeast. They were directly south when I initially noticed them. At first I saw two that appeared to be a little higher, thus smaller. I would estimate them to have been 4000 to 4300 ft in altitude, but it didn't seem clear how accurate that might have been. Lower than those and seemingly a little larger (apparent size) were two more with one above and leading the other, also moving to the east. These I estimated to be about 2500 – 3000 ft altitude. I thought of how helicopters would be flying while I was watching. Within a minute of noticing them, the first two disappeared although I felt at first they just went out of range. Three more appeared to the southwest and moved similarly to, and at the same apparent altitude, as the second two. The higher of the second set had disappeared by this time, then shortly after that, the other one also disappeared. As the third group moved directly south of where I was, another two became visible to the southwest. I returned my attention to the set of lights south of me and two of them disappeared as I watched. The third of that group continued on to my southeast, and it was possible that it changed direction toward the southeast at that time. The upper of the next set of two disappeared somewhere to my southeast but the other continued on as the single remaining one of the previous group had done. Two more sets of two became visible in about the same timing and location, also moving to the east, and one of those four also remained to follow the others that stayed visible going toward the southeast. To recap: several groups of similar to identical reddish orange lights moved from southwest to southeast relative to my position. Most disappeared but three total appeared to continue visibly to the southeast. The movement seemed to be how helicopters would have been flying but there was no sound. They might have been 1.5 – 3 miles away. There were no strobe lights or red beacons I could see, but if traditional aircraft, the port red light would have been visible. However, the color was more orange than I would have thought. The lack of standard aircraft lighting was strange as where they were is the approach to Detroit Metro airport ; we live directly under the westernmost approach and aircraft would be flying toward the southwest right into where these lights were. No aircraft made an approach during that time, however. There seemed to be a shape to the lights, sort of an irregular trapezoid on its side, base to the rear, and the top segment at more of an angle than the bottom one. This, though, was an impression and not easily discernible. After the first 4 groups had gone by I had the idea to try my smart phone video to capture images, but the quality is pretty poor. I offer it anyway, if desired. I am a retired US Navy Aerographers Mate (meteorology and oceanography) with 20 years service.  I have a private pilot's license but haven't flown since 1992.

On July 17th, 2015, at 23:00 I was out for a bike ride.  Upon riding down a dead end street at about 23:20, I could see a truck shining a bright halogen spot light up into the sky, as they were bringing attention to something.  There were 6 residents pointing up in the sky.  I noticed they were pointing at a red/orange fireball moving up from the ground up into the sky about 2.5 miles away.  I rode my bike back one block and went down a dark, dirt path in a undeveloped part of town, where there were no background lights, completely pitch black.  This area has no obstructions and overlooks a inlet of Lake Michigan. I climbed up on a sugar sand hill. I saw 1 orange/red round fireball climb up from, what we local residents call “The Bluff” a 200ft elevation change on the west side of the city.  The fireball climbed to approx. 500ft, it then started forward motion and began a huge sweeping left hand turn out over Little Bay De Noc.  After moving across the water, it gently faded out and disappeared. As soon as it was dimming out of sight, I noticed 2 more rising up 1 after another, from the same location as the first one. They 2 made the same sweeping turn at about 1500ft to 1800ft. I have flown in a Cessna around this area before. At one point there were 4 flying. Although they flew the same circuit, it was not the exact speed every time. There were some small variations. This continued for at least 20 minutes. I was quite interested in watching this, as this was not my first time observing these fireballs. Last summer I had a much closer sighting. This being my second sighting I was not so shocked to see the fireballs, this time I took more time to get a description of them. As I squinted at them, they appeared to have a central upside down “V” with 2 round points at the bottom of them. They have a bizarre flickering effect, almost like the “licking of flames, from a fire” with the “V” in the middle. They seem to pulse between red to yellow. Both elements put together, it looks like a cross between a bright filament in a clear light bulb and someone puffing a cigarette at night, a very smooth red/orange/yellow pulse. After spending 8 years in the military, I have been around both F-16 fighters and numerous helicopters. These things are absolutely silent, no distant “JUH,JUH,JUH or ROARS” at a 2.5 mile distance. I can determine a few things, these are not: fireworks helicopters private planes commercial planes helium type “Fire Lamps” RC planes / 4 blade RC drones, to far away to control by radio. They just have too much speed, and the point of origin that they start from.

My husband went out side to check the steaks and he called to us in the house saying, ""Hey!  I think I see some UFOs"".  We all ran out side and just stood side by side and watched a most amazing sight... out over Lake Michgan.  There were 3 big round BRIGHT lights out over the lake in a row... just hovering... then the light on the south side just shot off to the south towards Chicago... then the light on the north side shot off to the north... then the light in the middle shot off eastward... over our heads... at a speed the likes I've never seen before NOR SINCE!.... it seemed to be climbing too as it flew over our heads...  All the lights seemed to fly so unbieveable fast... that they just vanished in seconds.  The next day in the News Paper, the News Platium of Benton Harbor, Michigan, had a huge article about the sighting (none of us called in any report)... the article was lengthy because 100s & 100s of people called in reporting that sighting... the article even mentioned some prominent community members as making reports about the sighting... the article reported the sighting just as we ourselves witnessed it.   I am sure there were many others like ourselves too out there on the Lake Michigan Bluffs who seen it all too, just like us 4 did... and just as we did... didn't call anyone to make a report...  It was such a beautiful summer night... there had to be 1000s of folks out on the bluffs that night... and 1000s that seen those lights.   I have considered going to the New Platium and looking through their archives trying to find that article... on the ocassions that I've gone back to Michigan for visits; (I now live in Colorado)... Anyways... I know it occured sometime between 1966-1969... it seemed like it was in July or August...  It was a night I'll never forget...

((NUFORC Note:  We have tried to contact the source of the report, principally to inquire whether the report is a sincere one, or whether it might be a hoax.  PD)) Last Thursday night, I was sleeping at home, when I woke up with the feeling that somebody was breaking in my house.  I went to have a look, and as I went to get up out of bed, I found myself paralyzed in place.  I felt really scared, like I was having a nightmare or something.  When I tried to close my eyes, I couldn’t close them, and I looked around up in the air, I assumed myself to be in a dream, but I couldn’t wake up, so I started scream, and before I could get a sound out in a single second, I was floating above my bed and I felt a deep very low frequency hum like a large transformer was inside my body.  Then I could see behind me back at my bed, and my cat, who sleeps by me, didn’t even seem to care or notice that I wasn’t in my bed anymore.  I was absolutely terrified and right, as I was about to scream, I started floating toward my wall of my bedroom. To my shock, I went right thru the wall, like I was a ghost or the wall was liquid, and as I saw thru my wall, I was feeling this vibration intensify greatly, like a force of my body was going to explode from inside out.  I passed out completely, and when I remember waking up, I realized that I was in some type of white science looking laboratory room of some sort.  I again, assumed I was dreaming, until I saw a face looking down at me.  It was a large head, with black bug-like eyes, and in my head as I went to scream, I heard it say don’t be afraid of me, you are safe with me.  I don’t know how to explain it, but it said it thru my brain, like a mind reader would read your mind.  The voice sounded like I was saying it to myself, instantaneously to myself. Then I went to ask, what’s going on, and before I could talk, again it said don’t worry, and said we’re zeta brothers.  I didn’t really understand what that means, but as I could see more clearly, I immediately noticed, that the! se weren’t people at all, it was an oblong looking bug eyed grey skinned, probably around 3 feet tall, with a silver suit made of some kind of spandex.  It had a tiny little slit where the mouth was, and just holes for ears.  It's head was wobbling on what I remember thinking was a tiny neck right in the middle, and it's hands looked like they were really skinny and long, with almost no texture, just like the texture of the lining of a hot dog casing.  This thing that I can only explain look wise, as an alien creature. When I asked it to go home, another one came in the room, and they were talking to each other without talking, and one said, something in a weird sounding almost African type of language, and they came back next to me but in an instant, no walking, just teleporting back to above me, and the other of the two took off my pants, and put a strange circular light orb on my genitals, and it was very painful.  I immediately felt as though I was being burned on my penis, and it then took the ball off me, and the pain instantly stopped. Then the one holding the light ball disappeared in a flash out of my view, and the other above me said I want to show you him, and a different taller bright white one of these things came out walking with what looked like a little girl, but with some of the facial features of these creatures, and it looked up at me and said “you know who I am”, This scared me terribly and immediately I remember falling back asleep. When I woke up again, it was the next morning and I was back lying in my bed, without my covers being disturbed, and immediately assumed it was very scary nightmare.  Then, I when I went to get out of bed, my ankle felt as though the same vibrational burning sensation was coming from under my skin by my bone in my leg, so I looked down, and noticed that there is a small maybe 1/8th of an inch circular cut out and burned mark on my leg, but it goes down like 4 layers of my skin, as if someone had literally punched a hole with a paper punch out of it, and then burned it closed.   For the past few days, I haven’t really been able to tell if this was a dream, or real, but strange feelings happen to my leg and I hear weird static sounds in my head when I feel it.  I keep also, seeing a strange pattern of a triangle, with two circles in it, which looks like some sort of geometric constellation when I start to fall asleep every night since.  I don’t know still if I was just dreaming of this, or if it really happened, but I can't explain why I am still feeling and seeing weird things, or the hole on my leg I found the morning after this all happened.",2015-06-15T00:00:00,43.60592137404584,POINT(-84.80228625954189 43.60592137404584),-84.80228625954189

I was camping in the Boundary Waters on Bald Eagle Lake with my family.  The location was just after we passed into Bald Eagle Lake from Gabbro Lake.  My sister (age 40) and I (age 43), were lying on a big rock next to the lake looking at the starry sky.  I was showing her how to look for satellites as I had been taught to do by a friend (looking for Sputniks) when I was a kid.)   We watched what we first thought was an airplane passing across the sky and noticed that it was not creating any sound in the otherwise fairly quite night.  I pointed out that it did not have the typical, rhythmic flashing of lights like a plane, and she remarked, ""That's not how a plane moves!""  Because it was traveling at a strange angle, and at a speed that did not seem right.   Within the next 15-30 minutes we saw it two more times, passing in different directions and out of of our view (went behind the tree line behind us.)  Each time we thought out loud about what it could be, ! such as a drone? and tried to come up with an explanation for what we saw.  We did not see it again that night, nor the next as a storm came in. The lights seemed to flash across the object, rather than from the same location.  We did see satellites that night and were able to contrast what they looked like with this object, which if it were a plane, was traveling at an altitude low enough where I would think we would hear some engine noise.   I also downloaded a constellation app that night that my sister told me about to see if there was a space station or other object that might have tricked us.  I tried to take a picture and video with my iPhone but the image is just black. Also potentially of interest, is that sometime during this sky viewing (my sister may recall best if we saw the plane-type thing first) is that she saw a really bright, glowing light to the right of where we were, across the lake.  I asked her if it could have been a fire-fly, and she said she did not think so.  I asked her other details, such as if the light illuminated anything around it, and she said it did not.  The next day we looked over where she saw the light and there is a low bluff, and potentially a camping site within 1/4 mile of where she saw the bright light.  We imagined it possible that someone could have shown a light, but thought it strange that it would be a one-time lighting and nothing further. My sister and I are both health care professionals.  I am an avid coast to coast listener, very open-minded and curious, while I would say that my sister is less open to ideas about UFO's, so I was surprised that she was so adamant about this object not being a plane.",2015-07-03T00:00:00,,,

It seemed quite large, a fireball, with no discernible flashing lights,.. Report received by the Missouri Investigators Group. http://ufomig.yolasite.com. BBecker ufomig@yahoo.com. I had spent the late afternoon, early evening, at my mom's house, with family, at Lake Timberline, Bonne Terre, MO.  I would not attend the evening's fireworks display there, as I had a prior commitment to walk my friend's dog by 9pm (my friend was staying out of town that evening...he lives just west of Highway 67 in Farmington, MO).  Because of my commitments, I was paying particular attention to the time.  I left my mom's house for Farmington by just before 8:30 pm, heading north to my friend's house, and arriving at around 8:45pm.  I took out his dog for a walk in the yard.  We finished by 9:00 pm, and I remember hearing what certainly sounded like very large fireworks going off in the east, toward Farmington.  I assumed it was their annual display.  As the dog seemed increasing nervous at the sounds, I took her back in the house and left for my home in Farmington.  I got on to Hwy 67 south, hung a left on Hwy H, headed east into Farmington.  I continued to hear the ""booming! "" of what seemed to be Farmington's fireworks display, now behind me as I entered the city limits.  There was some traffic that had passed on Hwy H heading west, and I was looking ahead at another oncoming vehicle, when just over the treetops appeared what I initially thought was a small plane.  It is not uncommon to see small aircraft in this area as the pilots descend and make their way toward landing at the small Farmington airport.  I suppose my immediate thought was that it could be dangerous perhaps for a small plane to be out, at this time on the July 4th holiday, so close to a large fireworks demonstration.  The craft did not seem to be heading in a straight line, but sort of a ""bee line"" to the west-northwest.  It took only seconds to realize that there were no flashing lights or beacon on this craft, it seemed very low, but very large, glowing brightly in an orange-red hue.  I realized that this was unusual and I found my self startled.  Quickly, I glanced! in my rear-view mirror, saw not traffic behind me. I slammed ! on the b rakes, and backed my car up twenty or thirty feet into the nearest drive, and parked, with my car facing north. I looked out my windshield and viewed the craft headed west. It seemed quite large, a fireball, with no discernible flashing lights, as with a plane or helicopter. I whipped out my cell phone and attempted to film the light. As soon as I got the recorder operating, I realized that filming through the windshield could interfere getting a ""clean"" recording, so I exited the vehicle quickly, with the phone in my right hand. I stood outside the car, between the open door and the car, leaning on the vehicle to steady my hand. The craft seemed to have moved further to the north of me, and as I filmed, it ceased to move, and hung in midair. I looked like Venus would appear in the night sky, but was as twice as bright as Venus, burning in that orange-red hue. While I watched and filmed, it seemed as though the craft appeared as a ""V"" shaped, but I cannot! be sure. After minutes, the object began to move due north, disappearing gradually from my line of sight. I recall stopping the camera record feature on the cell phone, and climbed back into my car. I was excited to see what I had filmed. I then realized that only ten seconds of video existed of this sighting, ending as I began to exit the vehicle, with no visual of the light I attempted to film from the windshield. I thought perhaps I ""jostled"" the phone upon exiting the car, but I cannot account for the fact that I remember stopping the camera record feature on my phone when the experience ended. Because there was no video to prove what I had seen, needless to say, I was extremely pissed off. I drove the rest of the way home, and explained to my waiting wife, what I had seen. I put a post on Facebook at about 9:34pm, asking if anyone else had seen this. Surprisingly, only a few responded, and some with skepticism. I was probably ranting at my wife for hours abo! ut this. How can tens of thousands of people be sitting outsid! e watchi ng the sky, and no one saw what I had seen? In retrospect, and this is purely speculation, I was left feeling that this object was responding to the fireworks in town, stopped within a short distance to observe, and then tracked slowly northward. I was extremely agitated after this experience, and in the following week, I would go outside around the same time of the evening to see if this craft would return, and I could get another chance at filming it.

Something in the sky above Sunset Hills, MO, on March 12th, 2012, at 11:54AM. I was driving Northbound, and saw something moving across the sky.  It looked kind-of like a cloud at first.   I pulled over because it was a very clear day, no clouds were in sight, and it struck me as odd.  I was amazed when I got out of my car, immediately began filming and even tried to capture what I saw by putting my sunglasses over the lens.  It was iridescent, glittery, sparkly, and free forming, silent, non-solid, varying opacity, fluctuating size and essentially shapeless.  The form was too high up for me to gauge if the wind was affecting it or not.  The wind (on ground level) was moving South-East, and the form seemed to move East North-East.   Initially, I only saw one form, then suddenly another appeared.  The forms were offset, and near one another; however, I cannot calculate the actual distance.  The forms dissipated and reappeared a few times.  About 10 minutes after seeing it, I stopped filming (I filmed just over 7 minutes).  Once I had stopped filming it seemed to mo! ve too far out of my visual range and started moving South. It appeared as two fading, alive shapes. I filmed this from a parking lot off Lindbergh Ave/highway 67 going north between Chrisann Ln and Court Dr.  The nearest airports are 10-30 miles away.  There are no military bases within 35 miles from the location.  There is a National Weather Station about 15 mi from the location. I am a musician, photographer, artist, jewelery designer, and poet.  I have dogs, I play video games, and I live to watch the sky.  So far I can't figure out what this is.   This happening has worn on me for over three years and I remember it as though it just happened moments ago.  A recent sighting has brought me here, this sighting happened in Philly on July 5th, 2015.  When I heard of this, I knew I was not alone and felt more comfortable with sharing my story.  My imagination, even as an artist, is lost on this.  I have a few theories, but they're just that; theories.  I have studied what I can, and am still at a dead end road.

In the summer of 1989 or 1990, I don't remember which, I was driving with my then-girlfriend north on State Line, near 89th Street. It was probably no later than seven o clock, because it was very light. She was first to notice what appeared to be a tumbling, white object. It appeared to be disintegrating, but was not throwing off light. It was traveling S-N and seemed to be on a near level path. We were in busy traffic and lost sight of it. My girlfriend noticed it because she thought it was a plane crashing! But there was no report of any crash that day, and I was aware of no one else who witnessed the phenomena. I would have loved to have watched it standing on that road instead of navigating a car through busy traffic at 40 mph! I was amazed how similar this report was to mine, and was especially intrigued by the geographic proximity of the two sightings. I had always chalked it up to a meteor, but the lack of light and the fact no one else seemed to have seen it (it was really spectacular) always puzzled me. Now I don't know what to think!

My cousin has worked in military and is familiar with helicopters and other aircraft.   Neither me nor him heard any noise, nor did his aunt, but another witness said they heard  a noise such as an aircraft.  We as well as other saw 2 to 3 different lights hovering, blinking off and on.  Sometimes pulsing off and on.  Sometimes solid colors and sometimes changing colors, mostly white lights, but also red, blue, and other colors.  I believe a witness or two call the union police depth and some other organization, not for sure if local airport, etc., and said there were no planes or helicopters reported in area.  One of the lights would be the brightest, brighter  than any aircraft or planet,  I did not witness any other days, but on June 24 the next night 2 lights were back.    I also saw about a week before that the St Louis news channel called fox2now.Com had a reports from many witnesses of strange lights around the union and at Louis area a week before all of this.

I have memories from my child hood from ages as early as 5 to 12 years old of missing time and also sleep walking multiple times,  I grew up in my grandparents home, and my sleep walking going getting out if bed and going outside got so bad, sometimes they would stay up to watch me and also add extra locks on doors so it would cause it to be harder for me to get outside.

I moved several feet away from the tree to get a better look.  ""What a big star!"", I thought.  ""I wonder if that is a planet, maybe mars, that is closer than normal.  But I've seen mars many times and it's never THAT big.""  It was big and roughly circular, though hard to tell the shape because it was bright.  After looking at it for a few seconds I saw it start moving.  It was a sort of dirty orange or orangish-brown color.  More orange than brown, but not a neon orange.  It did not blink or pulsate at any time.   I've never seen aircraft with lights of that color and aircraft lights usually blink.  When it started moving I at first thought maybe it was some sort of sattelite that was! very close.  But then it didn't move in a straight line.  This was definitely not a meteor or an airplane.  I doubt a helicopter could have moved the way it did, and again, I've never seen helicopter lights this color or helicopter lights that don't blink.  There would be no reason for a helicopter to move in this fashion and I've never seen a helicopter move this way, though I suppose it might be possible.  A helicopter is the only craft I know of that can fly in a non-linear way like this.  Also, I never heard a helicopter noise, or any other noise during this sighting.

It appeared round, with a little “haze” circling the perimeter which could be attributable to the smoke from neighborhood firework displays.  I lowered my window but did not hear any sound other than our car.   As we descended the! hill, the object was still visible but was somewhat obscured by the trees.  My husband turned west onto I-70 Drive SW and we attempted to keep it in view but couldn’t.

Submitted by:  BBecker ufomig@yahoo.com   My experience occurred on the night of Wednesday, 6/17/15.  My youngest daughter and her fiance were staying with us from out of town that week, and they had gone out for the evening, leaving us with their dog, Mosby, a Yorkie.  My wife and I had been watching television in our living room.   I noticed that it was 9:00 p.m. Central time, or getting close to the top of the hour. Keeping with my routine, we made our way to bed to settle in for the night.  After quickly getting comfortable in bed, I heard Mosby bark.  We called him, but he didn't come in to answer our call, so I climbed out of bed and saw him setting patiently at the front door, which indicated to me that he had to go out.  I pulled off his ""diaper"" and hooked up his leash and took him outside so that he could take care of business.  I recall the weather conditions seemed uncomfortably warm and humid that evening.   I began to look at nearby house and street lights and I thought that it looked unusually haze. I then at the sky, and noticed the moon and a few stars. The stars seemed evident, but they too were hazy because of weather conditions.  I then looked nearly straight up over me.  As I was looking up, I saw a flash of light.  The duration was only a second, but since I was viewed it straight on and not out of the corner of my eye, I felt it was not a trick of the light caused by my eyesight or glasses.   The flash, or streak, seemed very bright, brighter than the moon, with the intensity of lightning or an electrical flash. It was silent.  It would be difficult to say for sure that it was streaking, as it was so quick, but the flash seemed to indicate a movement to the north (it was almost directly above, perhaps a little to my east).  The flash seemed defined in its edges, and not subject to the haziness of the other lights and heavenly bodies I had observed.  While I did not get the impression that it was close to the ground, it seemed large...I would measure the width of the light by holding my hand straight out above me, with my arm extended fully and holding our my index finger...the flash was the width of the tip of my index finger.   The length of travel seemed to be half the length of that index finger. It was so fast, I questioned as to whether I actually had seen this.  It did not seemed similar to any other meteor, comet, or natural object I have seen before.  It did not resemble any man made object with which I am familiar.  The flash seemed very similar to that of an object I watched for minutes back in the 1990's when I resided in Festus/Crystal city.   This object moved with intent, up, down, and sideways with great speed, hanging in the air near the ground, high in the air, until zipping off to the west with a flash...exactly like I witnessed most recently.  Because of my previous sighting, I feel strongly that the object I viewed this month was not viewed as it had been in motion, but had been hanging directly above me, and zipped away as I looked upward in it's direction.   After the sighting that night, I could not arrive at a comfortable conclusion as to what I viewed, and I decided it best to take the dog back inside.  Mosby had not acted out of the ordinary during this time.  My trip outside lasted five to ten minutes, perhaps.  I told my wife what I had seen, and we went to bed.  I mentioned it to my daughter the next day.   Later in the afternoon on Thursday, she read the news article on Facebook from Fox 2 news regarding the Affton lights.  While I found that video compelling, the only similarity between that incident and what I viewed was the time of occurrence.

On the evening of July 4th, not long after sunset, my girlfriend and I were driving West on Business 40 (we had just passed Interstate 40/Business 40 split) and noticed a bright, glowing orange orb passing in front of us above the tree line at approximately 50-75 ft above the ground, moving in a direction from our left or out of the south, towards our right, or to the north.  We both noticed it immediately because both of our eyes were transfixed at the sky because we had just witnessed a lot of fireworks just above the tree tops as we drove out of Greensboro heading towards Winston-Salem, with it being Independence Day.  My first thought was that we were viewing a falling ember from an exploded firework cascading down from the sky, however it was quickly evident that this wasn't true because the small craft was clearly flying in a trajectory perpendicular to our vehicle not losing altitude. We were both very intrigued and I quickly looked in my rearview to che! ck for other cars, and slowed down to get a better look.  The orange light kind of resembled a flame almost like an oil lamp, with a distinct glowing orb surrounding it.  The only thing that I could reasonably think that this small craft could be was a drone, possibly attempting to get views of the evening fireworks, however several factors lead me away from this assumption, because there were no houses or business around the area. It was a darkened and desolate portion of the highway, with trees on both sides and neither myself nor my girlfriend saw any wings or any identifying signs that would lead us to believe it was a manmade drone or craft.  Drones typically need the operator to be fairly close, and with no homes or side streets anywhere near the area a drone seems unlikely, especially when it was fully dark and a drone would seemingly have no photographic value in darkness. Both me and my girlfriend were very interested in what we had saw and neither of us could explain! it. There is no possible way it was a firework or ember acting weird or caught in the wind, it was definitely flying.  I wish I would have had more time to view the craft and contemplated pulling to the side of the roadway, but more cars were coming up behind us and the vehicle was close to crossing the tree line on the northern side of the road.

Disc or cylindrical craft moving at very high speed,Chapel Hill,NC,2015-06-29T12:30:00,cylinder,5 seconds,"Occurred : 6/29/2015 12:30  (Entered as : 06/29/2015 12:30) Reported: 6/29/2015 5:53:45 PM 17:53 Posted: 7/3/2015 Location: Chapel Hill, NC Shape: Cylinder Duration:5 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/119/S119893.html,"Disc or cylindrical craft moving at very high speed On June 29, 2015, about 10 miles outside of Chapel Hill, NC, travelling south towards Charlotte, NC, I witnessed an object that looked very much like a disc or possibly cylindrical craft.  It was apparently a considerable distance away, so it was difficult to ascertain whether it was truly a disc, or whether it was a cylinder; however, it appeared to have no wings and did not have any type of propulsion mechanism that could be seen. It was clearly a silver or gray color.   I cannot provide an accurate distance of the object from my vantage point, but it seemed to be somewhat equidistant between the locations of frequently sighted high-flying commercial jets and lower flying, small, private airplanes.  I realize this estimate is not very helpful, but it was just too difficult to give a good estimate of distance.  Although based on the uncertainty introduced by the distance of the craft from my vantage point, one could perhaps attempt to explain it away as some type of mundane craft; however, it was the observations regarding the apparent shape, coupled with the speed of the object that made me decide to report it.  The speed truly caught my attention.   I originally sighted the craft directly ahead of my vantage point looking south and at about 30deg up from the horizon against a clear blue sky.  From the time I spotted the object until it moved across the south to western span of the sky to below the tree line on the western horizon, only about 4-5 seconds passed, maybe a little less.    As I watched it move, it was clearly far faster crossing the sky than the apparent movement of a high-flying commercial jet (which appears to move very slowly as most anyone knows who has seen a high-flying jet followed by its contrail).  Likewise, it was much, much faster than the apparent speed of low flying, small, private planes.   It appeared to move across that expanse of the sky even faster than the speed of some lower-flying military jets that I have seen in the past.  From the time I saw it until I could get my daughter's attention to try to look at it, the object was already out of sight behind the trees on the western horizon.  If the distance I had estimated was accurate, then this craft was moving at an extremely high speed.  It was truly moving faster than any conventional aircraft that I have seen. So, in summary, it was not only the apparent disc or cylindrical shape of the craft that caught my attention, but also the speed that made me think it was something truly unusual. Although I was unable to take a photograph, it looked very much like the object in the photo of the High Plains, Oregon, sighting of June 14, 2015, at 1230hrs (Pacific), which is shown on the NUFORC website (although the object I saw was quite a bit more distant and probably a third of the apparent size as seen from my vantage point). Furthermore, I was in a car when the sighting took place, so I cannot make any comment about the possible sound of the craft. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Thank you for your interest.  Your work on the NUFORC site is admirable. First, the size, as compared to the moon at that same location (on a hypothetical full-moon night), was estimated to be about 1/10th the size of a full moon (at a 30-35 degree location and not exaggerated by atmospheric effects).  Again, I estimate this based on envisioning a cylinder/disc sitting over a full-moon and deducing the amount of the moon covered. The following is my best estimate regarding movement: As I stated, the object originally appeared to be about 30-35 degrees above the horizon, directly in front of me.   When it went out of sight about 4-5 sec later, it was hidden because of the interference of the tops of trees on the western horizon.   Those tree tops were approximately 10 degrees from the horizon.  So, I suppose one could say the object traversed an expanse from 30 degreess to 10 degrees in about 5 seconds.  Does this help answer your question?  If you need more detail, let me know, and I'll do the best I can.  Remember, I have a chemistry background, not physics.  Ha!  I will leave the heavy lifting to you. And to the last point - no, my daughter was never able to see the object.  It simply moved too quickly. Best regards, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((ADDENDUM #2)) Dear Mr. Davenport, I hope my contacting you so soon after my response to your inquiry about my initial UFO report does not damage my credibility as a witness; however, the more I think about my response, I believe I have let that Oregon photo on your site cloud my objectivity. I simply do not believe the object I saw was as large as 1/10 of the full moon.  Please pardon my excitement and erroneous description in response to your question.       To explain, I responded by saying that I thought the object I saw was 1/10th the size of a full moon, but the more I consider it, I believe this quick response is not accurate.  Considering my difficulty in judging the shape of the craft (disc vs cylinder) leads me back to a more reasonable estimate of size as 1/20th the size of a full moon.   I feel that this is a far more accurate reflection of what I observed.  The object was quite small, but still clearly a disc or cylinder shape and apparently not a plane or commercial jet due to its speed. It becomes clear to me, as I honestly endeavor to provide accurate information, how difficult it is to obtain reliable witness testimony, especially when there is only one witness.  I so wish that my daughter had also observed the object, so that I would have some confirmation of my perceptions. Please consider this updated information as an addendum to my initial report. Best regards, ((END ADDENDUM #2)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #3)) Dear Mr. Davenport, I recently reported a sighting (Chapel Hill, NC on June 29) and was perusing the NUFORC database to see if any other similar reports had been made on that day.

I am writing simply to inform you that I believe you are mistaken and possibly have me confused with someone else.  We never spoke by phone, and I am a chemist and polymer/chemical patent research professional - nothing to do with aviation.

I live in Fremont, 50 miles north of Lincoln, and the midway point is approximately at Wahoo.  I was listening to the car radio, so I decided to take the longer way home at around 7:30 pm. North out of Wahoo, Highway 77 turns east 5 miles, then turns north again toward Fremont.  I had just made this turn north, when my radio started cutting out.  The early winter hours made it dark by this time, and nobody was on this road. I started to fidget with the radio tuner thinking it was going out, and within 100 yards-- in front and to the left of the road--a bright craft rose up behind a row of trees flanking a run-down shed. It was a weird neon green color-- surrounded by a halo.  It rocked back and forth quickly and several times in a jerky, erratic movement.  It was in my sight for so long I was able to make out something like ""windows"", and inside these ""windows"" I saw these weird, creepy ""things""-- silhouettes of beings or something-- flitting back and forth.  The craft accelerated to the right-- over the highway to the east, and the minute it passed entirely over the road, it fizzled out like a fireworks display. My radio came back on again, and I looked at my watch wondering if I'd lost time, but it seemed about the same as before-- around 730 pm. As you can imagine, I hit the gas and flew the last 10 miles back to Fremont.  I told my family members over the next couple days and they didn't know what to think, I'm sure. Since then at this area north of Wahoo, the shed has been demolished, but the windbreak of trees are still there-- now only flanked by cornfields.

After a few moments, my eyes started to wander off to the left (westward) towards the bike path that is provided to us by our municipality.   As I started to look that way, I noticed something in the sky.  I glanced up and instantly dropped my cigarette. Above the tree line on the bike path, there were two red objects hovering.  They glowed a bright red light and seemed to flash and change colors from red to white.   After a second or two of standing there, I ran inside to grab my iPhone so I could record this event.  I work in television production and have been around drones for a lot of that work.  I also fly weekly for my job.  I'm in and around planes and airports and have been for the last 12 years. These objects were not drones.  They were not planes. I took 2:30 mins of footage before my phone's battery started to die.  It was inside on the charger initially and was only around 5% charged when I took the footage. The two objects hovered for awhile, then one took off and flew away. Far away.  They were both pretty large at first.  Smaller than a full moon but much larger than a star.  The one that flew away though did eventually become small enough that it looked like a star. After a few more seconds, 20 maybe, the one that flew off - which was the one situated on the right hand side - reappeared on the left hand side, lower - again by the tree line and much larger. The two hovered again for about a minute. My phone was dying. I ran back inside to charge it and after a few minutes, I came back outside with my 3 year old son.  We recorded another 20 seconds of footage and he - though very young and being a child - was able to identify the object and you can hear his voice call it ""the flashing star"". I'm well educated. I work for a Fortune 500 company. I have a child and I'm an excellent father. I've been around drones and planes for my work. This was neither. My very first reaction was to run and grab a camera.  That wouldn't have been my reaction if I had ever seen anything like this before.  It's also important to note that Northfield is a very normal and pristine little borough outside of Atlantic City.  The area here is quiet and family oriented and filled with decent people.  This is not a hoax or a gimmick or some weird thing. I saw two UFO's.

The (presumably) same object was seen in two different locations at two different times by the same observer. Driving east on Route 37 I spotted a rectangular object to the east. My position was near the intersection of Hooper Avenue on Route 37 East near 149 Route 37 East in Toms River. The object was rectangular, white, and moving southward relative to my position. It was very small leading me to believe the object was a mile or two from my current position. My first impression was, ""This was just a large banner someone's flying over the Seaside Heights beach.""  Beach banners tend to be red letters on black netting, rather than presented as a large bedsheet.  What convinced me to contact MUFON was not seeing a plane towing it.  My father-in-law was in the car with me, I remarked, ""That's strange,"" but he was oblivious or thought I was talking about something else.  Before I approached the Stop and Shop on 353 Route 37, the object was now low on the horizon and difficult to observe. The distance between the two points is a little over a mile. We made a stop and drove south down Coolidge from Bay Avenue. While heading south on Coolidge, and passing Raider Way, time approximately 17:05, I saw the white rectangle again. No plane was visible towing the object.   After (maybe) two minutes, the object went behind trees while heading south.  The rectangle was a bit larger from this vantage.  The object was hidden by treetops before I reached the light on Windsor Ave.  This time I pointed out the object to my father-in-law, he remarked, ""Huh,"" but made no further comment. I believe there's a chance this might've been a case of mistaken identity, this being a banner, but banners tend to be much longer rather than having the dimensions of a postcard.  It's strange enough to report, and I'd like to know whether or not there's a prosaic explanation.",2015-07-06T00:00:00,39.984472727272596,POINT(-74.19884456762779 39.984472727272596),-74.19884456762779

We were near the Bloomfield exit when we first noticed it, and we both knew it was something strange, as we have driven that route our entire adult lives…  It was far away, but apparently enormous, judging by the tiny pinpoints of aircraft lights from the planes which flew in every direction in close proximity to the object (Close to Newark Airport!).  I wasn't sure what I was seeing, my first thought was that it had to be the penthouse of some building lit-up for a party, but it was so impossibly bright I couldn't imagine anyone wouldn't be immediately blinded!   We continued down the parkway and it was obvious that other drivers were seeing it too, because everyone was driving erratically, even my girlfriend was all over the road and I was sure we were going to crash.!   We managed to stay on course, watching the object grow larger and more detailed the closer we got.    By the time we reached our exit for Rte. 78 around Hillside/ Union, it was smack-dab next to us, and as we rounded the exit ramp there was a line of about 15 motorcyclists pulled over to the side, jumping up and down, screaming and pointing to the object!  Now that we were next to it, I could see that it was hovering right above the tree-line, and it was HUGE!  It was a soft sided triangle in shape; lit-up a fluorescent green that was more intense than any green I had seen before; it had a red light on the top that seemed to pulse like an organic heartbeat, I could feel it pulling at my chest with each pulse, that was the thing that terrified me the most; and it had a small, red flashing light on the bottom.   I kept yelling at my girlfriend to pull over, but she seemed disoriented and took the wrong exit, going the opposite way as the location of the object, as well as her home.  She proceeded to get us lost in an area that we were familiar with, but it seemed that we were both disoriented now and common landmarks became unrecognizable…  After a while we did make it back to her house, where I promptly jumped in my car and drove home in confusion of the night's events.  For weeks I tried to find a rational explanation for what we had seen, but really there was only one ultimate answer… We had seen a UFO!!!!

We looked at each other with wide eyes, and both said simultaneously, “What the hell is that?”  Then a very bright white light appeared outside the window.  The light seemed very low…barely clearing the top of the 2 story hotel.  It was angled down toward the ground.  We thought it was finished going over, but then a second round of the very loud bass sound began crossing the ceiling.

July 4th Sighting Over Las Vegas 2015  Las Vegas Sighting _ July 4th 2015_ 9 P. M. On a night when you'd expect to see an array of lights, my family / group and I never expected to see what we saw over the trees to the southeast of our driveway. Seven of us, my wife, two daughters and three of their friends, all grown, were over and enjoyed the 4th's activities, when at 9 P.M. we went outside to watch the fireworks. I noticed one of our company looking into the nighttime sky to the southeast, when I looked up and saw a lit up object that seemed to be something other then fireworks.  It was just hovering bright and blue-green in color at first, then it moved ever so slowly and I thought it was a helicopter, meanwhile it had all of our attention by now, except my wife who went inside for something. It was then that the airborne craft started to move and made a sudden turn and as it did it began to fade and reappear as a bright reddish-orange color, turn back to the direction it had been visible as a blue-green object and darted back to it's original position in the sky that we had first noticed it.  There it turned back to to the blue-green and started to maneuver through the sky as something very different then fireworks or helicopter or anything that I've ever seen. I called for my wife to hurry back out side and look at this object. I called to her twice and finally asked her to drop whatever she was doing and please come now! (Meanwhile fireworks are going off all around us and this craft has our rapt attention)!  My wife came back out and immediately started to film it on her smartphone, we ended up with approx. seven minutes of video but during that time all we could do is watch this object in between the burst of the fireworks celebration which it seemed very int! erested in as it seemed to be drawn to the larger explosions. It continued to change color between the blue-green to red-orange as it changed direction or sped up and slowed down. It had a range of speed from just hovering to darting through the sky in an instant, ascending, descending at times and changing course at very unusual angles, sometimes slowly, other times quickly. We all thought about what it could be, a very different firework, a helicopter, a blimp, a drone, a prank somebody conceived because everyone in the neighborhood would be watching up into the nighttime sky and what a dupe or ""viral-video"" that would make but in the end none of these made any sense. As in the end it darted out a bit of instant, returned half the distance and started to descend beyond the trees and went out of sight. We all at some point thought it was a UFO and explained what we each saw and all agreed it wasn't anything like any of us had seen before. My wife later uploaded her video to her computer and we both understood why 99% of the videos you see of the UFO sightings are so grainy, you just don't expect to see something like this and when you do you use the best tool available to you to record it and in this case it was a smartphone. Aliens, I don't know. UFO, meaning that none of us in our group could identify it, yes. I'm just hoping to see something about this on the news tomorrow to verify what we saw wasn't a July fourth event the city of Las Vegas put on to wow it's citizens! We're hoping others saw this as there have had to be dozens of witnesses with it being the 4th of July and so many would have been looking into the sky enjoying the firework celebrations.

We noticed what looked like a satellite moving sporadically and seemingly unintelligibly. Its ability to change direction, increase speed, and stop, was unlike I've ever ever experienced in my life.  Clouds became patchy and light which hid the object on us several times yet the object stayed in the general vicinity of the sky.   When the object became unable to see from a small cloud I noticed that there were actuall many such objects in the sky.

On Friday, July 3rd, 2015, at 9:20pm, as I was leaving the Nice-n-Easy parking lot in Phoenix, NY, I saw a stationary object in the southern sky above St. Stephen’s Church.  I extended my left arm toward the object and raised my thumb as a reference for size.  This object was the size of my thumbnail.  I estimated it to be approximately eight hundred feet above the ground.  I based this estimate on the objects location in relation to the peak of St Stevens Church below it, and the cumulus cloud cover behind it.  I would describe this object as a ball of light.  It was bright red, and twinkled orange to yellow at its core.  I had determined at this point it was not an airplane, helicopter, drone, or fire work flare.  It was stationary.  There was no sound associated with the object. I drove out of the parking lot on to Culver Street and traveled west intending to cross the bridge to lock island.  I continued to view the object.  I slowed down in order to observe the object for three or four seconds at a glance.  The object was now moving west parallel to my line of travel.  It had matched my speed of fifteen miles an hour and was visible at sixty degrees to my left as I traveled South West.  While I was on the bridge I again compared the object to the landscape and my thumb nail.  The cumulus cloud cover remained a reliable reference in the background.  It was now just above the trees located in the area of the old paper mill.  I estimated the object to be approximately two hundred feet above the ground.  Its size was still consistent with my thumbnail. I continued on Lamson Road and turned onto Pendegast Road. After traveling only a short distance, I pulled to the side of the road.  The object was behind me.  I stepped out of my truck.  At this point the object passed very close to me, approximately fifteen degrees off my zenith.  As the object moved in front of me I began to record it on my cell phone.  It was now in front of me traveling in a Northwest direction.  The object climbed steadily and maintained a trajectory of approximately sixty degrees above the horizon. The length of my recording was forty-one seconds. The time stamp of the recording was 20150707_213513.  I estimate the entire event lasted approximately fifteen minutes.

Looking westward up into the sky I noticed a dark object slowly moving through a northerly direction.  Object was at high altitude so it was hard to make out much detail other than it appearing featureless with no noticeable lights that most aircraft feature.  It was still daylight as sun was setting and minimum clouds were visible.  Object stood out as being the only craft in that section of the sky so it caught my eye.  I managed to view te object long enough to determine it was no plane or helicopter.  Object appeared to change direction from traveling northwest to northeast and seemed to be controlled by some intelligence so it was no balloon.  I eventually lost sight of it as it appeared to disappear over the clouds.  Not too many people were out in the area but I doubt anyone would've been able to see the object because it was really high up there.  My camera phone wouldn't capture it at that distance.

Obviously as we talked we had casual glances away from the sky but at one point one of the guys pointed to a “really bright” star that wasn't there earlier. We were discussing whether or not that was the case and that we probably just didn't notice it before when all of a sudden and as we were all looking at it, it looked like 6 “stars” came “from” this bright star and made a evenly spaced pattern or formation around it. NOW we were all focused on this what ever it was. The 6 “stars” nor the brighter center star moved for awhile as we watched then, the 6 “stars” sped off at very high speed in different directions as the larger “star” remained. High speed in this case means from standing stop to ZIP across the entire sky in a split second or actually less and GONE. Now we are suggesting and discussing that these aren't “stars”.  LOL  The larger … craft disappeared. Like the lights were just shut off. Some time later, the larger craft “came back” as we could see the bright light again and at the same location. It sat there for awhile by itself then all of a sudden all of the other 6 craft at very high speed, reformed around the brighter craft, stayed at those positions for a brief period of time then, all at the same time, at very high speed became one with the larger craft. The larger craft then stayed for a short period of time, maybe about 20 minutes, then it just disappeared like the lights were shut off. The lights of the smaller craft were not as bright as the larger craft. The lights of any of them flickered. The coloration of the lights were the same which was what I will call typical star light white.

No wings, no running lights. My one and only UFO sighting happened nearly 30 years ago.  It was a mild fall Oklahoma night in 1981, somewhat cloudy.  I was outside in the yard of my boyhood home when I noticed what looked like a white shaft of light, angled at about 45 degrees, casually hovering up and down in the sky against the eastern horizon.  Methodically, it would rise and then, slowly, steadily, it would drop, and then rise again, repeating this pattern, while I strained to figure out what it was. After performing the up-and-down hovering motion for a few minutes, the object instantly and noiselessly darted from the eastern horizon to directly overhead, stopped in midflight, and then shot back near to its starting point—where it continued to hover briefly before starting a sequence of movements across the sky, zipping from one horizon to another, stopping, starting, hovering, darting—always maintaining a 45-degree tilt. After about 10 minutes of watching (or being watched; I wasn’t sure which), I grabbed a pair of binoculars that I knew to be in a vehicle parked in the driveway. After a few frustrating moments of trying to train the binoculars on the object before it moved, it finally settled into one spot in the sky, almost directly overhead. As it hovered silent and stationary overhead, I could clearly see a cylinder shaped object, the color of polished aluminum.  It glowed from the inside out, illuminating the sky evenly all around it.  There were no windows, no running lights or gear, no wings. It was smooth and polished, one piece, solid. As I held the binoculars steady, the object suddenly vanished.  But as I continued to focus the binoculars on the same spot, seconds later, the object reappeared as suddenly as it had disappeared.  Moments later, it began to dart around again. Finally, the object sped away toward the south, gone within a couple of seconds, without a sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Spotted the popular three star triangle, and the waning moon to its left. Viewing from the SW to SE skies, directly above me.  In Homestead neighborhood right next to OHSU hospital. It started with one object, I assumed was a star shifting its light.  Then it began to move sporadically, circling and zig-zagging... slowly drifting upwards and to the right.  I used the moon as a still-object to make sure I wasn't seeing things. The longer I watched it, the more it moved.  No blinking or flashing lights.  Quick, sporadic movements in short spurts; sometimes in longer spurts.  Sometimes it grew still. Around twenty minutes into the sighting, while moving in circular motion, a smaller light spat out from it and vanished. I also find it interesting that during this 40 minute time period I saw two very large meteors and several much smaller ones. I report four objects, as there were two other much, much dimmer objects nearby moving in similar fashion. The third appeared after one of the large meteors, zig-zagged a small amount, and then moved on much like an airplane straight across the sky. The other three sightings were not as spectacular as the first, which remained... even after I ran back upstairs to grab my camera. Of course, since the light is the size of a star it was impossible to capture on my digital camera. Also worth mentioning is that last night, my roommate (who also witnessed this sighting) and I were driving home and saw what can only be described as a carousel-like ship.   Rotating slowly and moving slowly, with alternating white lights fading in and out.  They were not blinking, were not airplane beacons and were not red or green. Just white.  Rotating, or spinning, and moving across the sky in a diagonal manner. I am hesitant to label this immediately as a UFO, as it could very well be a drone.  However, due to the strange optical lights, fading alternately; and after doing a few hours of research on drones and their lightings, I found that most drones have stationary or flashing lights much like airplanes... not this gentle, soft fading white lights in alternating fashion. And lastly, on the fourth of July during fireworks, I also saw three star-like objects much like tonight's sighting: sporadic movement and quickly disappearing.  These sightings lasted mere seconds, unlike tonight's sighting in which the first object remained for 40+ minutes.

I looked above my trailer in the sky and saw what seemed to be an invisible rectangular object with four sets of blue and red paired lights beneath it.  The bright blue and red lights were paired together in four places like where the wheels would be under a car.  We did not see the rectangle object, only the lights.  These were large lights, not tiny pin-sized lights. They did not blink, only glowed cobalt blue and bright red very vividly.  At first it was just hovering, then it went up, away south, around and back again and that is when I realized it was not a helicopter.  Nothing could travel or turn that fast that I have ever seen before. We watched until it went up and disappeared into the east. I had a strange feeling while watching that it had been looking at the stars as well, knew we were looking at it, and was trying to get away from us.  I don't know if that is true, it is just a sense I had.  I did not feel afraid, just calm and curious.  I brushed it off, since someone I later spoke with said it was probably a drone.  But after thinking about it, this was too big to be a drone, and much too fast.",2015-07-23T00:00:00,44.0395449832778,POINT(-123.12515735785941 44.0395449832778),-123.12515735785941

While sitting outside on a deck at an approximate elevation of 400-500 feet above the Wilamette river looking to the East, 4 adults including myself witnessed an object crossing over head slightly South of our position. It moved at rapid speed from west to East toward the river. We discussed it's speed and at first thought it to be a satellite however as we watched it pass without sound we agreed it was too close to be a satellite. At this point the object slowed considerably to what looked looked like a stop and apeared to have some color qualities. At this point approximately 45 seconds after our first sighting, I became more puzzled as to what the object might be. It was too fast for conventional aircraft, made no noise and now had stopped. The sky was overcast but the object was visible the entire time. It had stopped approximately over Mt Scott at which time I asked my brother in law if he had binoculars, he said ther was a telescope inside. It was just inside and on a tripod. I quickly brought it outside to the edge of the deck. The object was still stationary and as i began to look it apeared to turn brightlights directly our direction. I was able to get approximately a 4 to 7 second clear look at the object. I was actually  shocked to see see the object through the telescope so clearly. It was not an airplane. It had a bright red light at the top of a triangular shape with many smaller lights running at angles down the sides creating the shape of a triangle. It actually looked more like a cone with small strings of lights running from the top point of the triangle down to the base. It was not moving very much toward the north so my brief vision was amazingly clear. When a actually realized what I was looking at was not an aircraft, I simply said to the group just that, ""that's not a plane"", it then moved to a point where it was obstructed by the house in front of us. I ran with the telescope 1 short block to a view spot at the end of the street where there was a 180 degree view looking East, bu! t was un able to find the object again. I could see however all the incoming aircraft to Portland international. There is actually a good deal of aircraft activity visible from both the deck and from the end of the block. It was easy to compare what I had seen to the other aircraft and I became even more clear the differences between what I saw and the aircraft in the area, both looking through the telescope and to the naked eye.

My two young daughters and I were at Clark Creek park in Salem, Oregon, 07/14/15 at around 5:10 pm.  The sky was clear and blue with a few clouds and it was a warm nice day.   I looked up near the southeastern part of the sky and noticed a stationary white object that was round, and had a sort of white or metallic look to it.  It might have very slowly moved while we observed it, but I can't be sure.   I had my Canon camera with me at the park, so I started to film it, and it was hard to keep it steady because my kid started crying, as most toddlers do when the stroller stops moving.   My 5 year old was talking about it as we have talked about ufos in the past and she was very interested in it.   It disappeared right before our eyes after only being there for a few short minutes, and we continued walking in the park picking berries.  I looked up again to see and it showed up again in around the same area of the sky.  It sort of had a translucent halo around it that was very! hard to see but I noticed it nonetheless.   It disappeared again and we were pretty excited.   A regular big white airplane showed up and flew past the area we had sighted the ufo, maybe the same height in the sky as well, and according to the size of the plane I'll guess that ufo was maybe half the size of the plane and a much brighter shiny white color.

I don't remember clearly.  It wouldn't turn its brights off, and there wasn't a spot to pull off until we hit a city we dubbed ""Creepsville,"" in a joking manner. We eventually hit a small convenient store, where we could pull over and smoke a cigarette. We talked and decided that we missed a turn to go back to Redmond, Oregon.  So we went back towards Newport and wasted time and gas going that direction, and getting to Newport, we stopped at a gas station, where I filled up on gas and went to the atm.  Afterwards we smoked another cigarette off to the side of the gas station and witnessed something in the sky.  My cousin pointed it out before anyone we looked and I wasn't very impressed, considering I didn't feel like I needed to be at the time, for the fact that 3 people had been witnessing it besides me.

Their was a nearly full moon and the sky was mostly clear with no discernible surface wind.  The high clouds were moving very slowly, almost imperceptibly suggesting light winds aloft.  I was watching distant lightning (50-60 miles away) from a storm passing near the Cape May/Delaware Bay, NJ, area that I was also watching on my Accuweather radar app. I saw a bright red object flying by to my right, and assumed it was an airplane, since I live directly under the approach route for Philadelphia International Airport.   Immediately, I saw an identical red object about 1/4 mile behind the first object, and slightly to the right of the first object.  This second object appeared to be gaining on the first object and moved to the right.  It looked like 2 planes flying in a loose formation.  I judged them to be about 2 miles away.  I would estimate their airspeed at somewhere around 200 mph. I am a 19 year licensed pilot, and I immediately noticed 2 unusual things about the  objects; they were completely silent and they weren't ""strobing.""  This is unusual because all aircraft are required by the FAA to have a green position light on the right wing, a red position light on the left wing, a strobe light on the underside of the aircraft, and a white position light on the tail.  These objects I observed were just glowing a steady red.   Also, I see aircraft at this distance every day and there is always audible engine noise, especially with 2 planes that close together on a quiet night.  These objects were silent. I immediately picked up my binoculars and was able to observe the objects for about 10 seconds.  They were glowing steady bright red, then they slowly faded for about 3 seconds before completely disappearing. About 10 seconds after this I saw 2 more identical objects flying in exactly the same area of sky at the same speed and at the same distance from each other.  I watched them through my binoculars and they disappeared in exactly the same location as their predecessors. I have an app on my Iphone, Flight Radar 24, that shows all the air traffic in the sky.  I immediately looked to see if their was any traffic in the area at that time and it showed nothing at all within miles of that area. I have another Iphone app, Sky Guide, which shows where all the satellites are in the sky and it showed nothing at all above my home.  I see satellites, meteors, and objects like the Intl.Space Station all the time.  These 4 objects were very different. So I'm really perplexed.

I was lying in bed thinking about the transporter system on the fictional starship Enterprise and after comparing it to other technology  I thought that perhaps they can do it and if they can they must have starships.  It was at this point that I spoke out loud and said, captain kirk, if your really up there,and you can really move matter around, can I at least have my front tooth back. I went to sleep and when I went into the bathroom in the morning.  I looked in the mirror and seen that my front tooth was restored and I remembered what I had asked the night before and to this day I still feel overwhelmed by what happened. I have given the incident much thought over the last 2-3 years and I think that it is a possibility that they heard me  because I was on a harbour at the time and said (captain), and the place where I was staying was an old hotel called ( the Anchor) and the organization running the old hotel as a hostel was the salvation army and among their ranks they have  a (captain). So what I am saying is that there must be some kind of surveillance systems that links up information that has similar content and passes that information on to related people. And yes after this happened to me I believe that captain kirk is a real person, and perhaps he always was and the secret about him and the starship got out and the powers that be made up star trek to cover the truth.  What I now know for sure is that  all sound  especially words are being monitored by persons unknown and they definitely have the power to move matter around. When I asked out loud for captain kirks help someone answered and gave me back my front tooth.  But the question now is do you believe me and what do you think.

My wife and i were travelling east on Route 30 east of Chambersburg, PA, on Saturday 4/29/2017.  My wife suddenly told me to pull over on the road because there were two objects in the sky in the proximity of a waxing crescent moon phase.   I have seen UFO objects twice in my lifetime before this at least 40 plus years ago.  We both looked at the objects while we were facing the west.  The two objects appeared to be larger than a planet, saucer/bell shapes in the sky, both were bright with an amber to white hue cast sort of pulsing as they stood at rest in the sky.   I had hoped that they would continue to get closer coming eastward to get a better look at them, but after about a minute, the one on the right began to slowly vanish followed by the one on the left then slowly vanishing.  There was a slight overcast with very high altitude cloud cover with some clearing.   When the objects vanished out of sight, it appeared as though they exited our atmosphere very quickly ! almost straight up and out.   Back in the early 1970's when i saw my first UFO, it occured in broad daylight, and actually had time to get my telescope out (50X) and sight in on it, before it quickly raced across the sky many times the speed of a modern military jet aircraft, and vanished as well.  I understand from my reading that the USA government does in fact have secret propulsion technology at Area #51 and has had it for years, continuing to unveil this high technology into military uses today.  I would not be surprised that the two UFO's we sighted on 4/29/2017 were engineered by our own government.  It is very exciting to see these objects, because it doesn't happen but once or so in a lifetime.  This is my third sighting in 43 years.  Now i must look at the skies every night.  My cell phone camera is too cheap, it would not have showed up well, but to be honest i just wanted to see these UFO's with my eyes.

I am writing to inform you of an unusual sighting I had with a friend, on June 17th, 2015. Our location is Nazareth, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley region of the state.  I was driving and he was in the passenger seat.  He will also be submitting a report on his perspective as well.  As I was driving, at the time, he of course got a slightly better look at the objects than I did.  However I will be submitting my perspective nonetheless. At approximately 9:25 PM, we were heading south on Blossom Hill Road, approaching a 3-way intersection with Newburg Road.  It had been a mostly cloudy and rainy day but had cleared up by this time and was a mild and partly cloudy evening.  At this point early in the evening, essentially no stars were visible in the sky.   As we approached the intersection we suddenly noticed a formation of 5 very brightly lit orange lights in a triangular or crescent formation.  They appeared to be hovering as a unit and had a certain “twinkle” to them similar to stars.  However, as noted before, there were not many (if any at all) stars visible in the night sky on this particular evening.  Although we were only approximately 8 miles from Lehigh valley international airport at this time, it was clear to both of us that these objects were very distinct from airplanes and appeared to act as a cohesive unit.  They were about as high in the sky as you would expect an average airplane to be, except appea! red to be “hovering” more so than “flying” to any particular destination.  It is also difficult to accurately size them because they were mere lights in the sky. At this point (after about 15 seconds) I had reached the intersection and put my car in park so we could get out and hopefully get a video of what we were witnessing.  At this point, the lights starting shifting into what appeared to be an “L” shape, moving together seamlessly almost as if they were a single craft.  Just seconds after they made the transition, they faded away one by one over about a 3-5 second span, almost as if they flipped a switch to turn their lights off.  Unfortunately, due to the brevity of the experience (about 30 seconds) and the limitations of our cameras on our phones we did not get the experience on video. As mentioned above, we do live close to an airport but these objects were very clearly not airplanes.  I also checked to see if there were any celebrations in my area that evening that could have had fireworks or something of the like, and there were not.   In addition, one of the most striking things about this experience is how much it mirrors many of the UFO sightings that have been reported within the past few years.   I am not implying that it was anything paranormal, but I have no way of explaining what we witnessed and it certainly demands further investigation.

Quickly I turned around just after a hill and headed back toward the light, I soon found myself beneath the light which appeared to be a silent aircraft approximately the size of two cars. I again turned to follow the craft and it quickly disappeared out of sight. For the next two hours I watched as an apparent star in the sky, with a similar color, moved on a constant basis.  My parents live local to me and witnessed the movement of this star along side me.  Later 2 additional moving stars appeared.

My wife and I, along with our 5 month old son, pulled over into a residential driveway off of Middle Road, Hampton Twp, to get a better view. While waiting for more flashes, we were startled by a low flying helicopter with no lights! The helicopter was only visible through these 'flashes' which occured evey 5-10 seconds.  It appeared that said helicopter was following the path of these 'flashes'. Once the flashes went over the tree line, my wife pointed out that a friend on Facebook also mentioned them over Cranberry Twp, in the direction in which we were presently. This evening was riddled with severe weather.  Prompting both flood and tornado advisories.  A tornado was even captured on film, which is extremeley rare for the area. This is the second time I have experienced an event like this while living here.  The first, was when I was 13, and noticed a ball of light morphing colors in the sky and dripping a liquid red substance. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time above.

It was white/yellow in color and was moving in a meandering path to the South.   While I viewed that one, I observed either flames or sparks coming out of the back or bottom of it twice.  Just as the object passed over our roofline, I took the dogs in and called for my fiancee to corroborate the sighting.  She immediately came outside, but by that time the object was not viewable from our backyard.  As I started around the side of the house for a better view of the southern sky, she called me back, saying that 3 objects were now visible in a roughly NW direction. I got back in time to witness all 3 of these objects one at roughly 290 degrees magnetic and the other 2 at approximately 310 degrees magnetic.  One of those 2 seemed to be slightly lower and to my right of the other, but since they looked to be far away I was unable to determine how close in proximity they were to each other....one could possibly be lower to the horizon than the other.  She also stated that these 3 objects emitted the same phenomena that I witnessed with the first object, but they did not do it in unison.  She stated to me later in the evening that at least one of the objects got close enough to our home for her to see that it was roughly triangular-shaped. I immediately ran inside for my phone, and by the time I returned only one of the objects was visble (I found out later on that the 3 we observed had ascended into the sky and vanished, and this was in fact the 5th similar object).  This one emitted the sparks/flames as well, but only once while I viewed it.  By the time I pulled up the camera app on my phone, it was already beginning it's slow ascent into the night sky, where it eventually vanished like the others that my fiancee observed. Neither of us heard any sound at all coming from these objects, and we could not explain their appearance due to a) there was no evidence of blinking lights as you normally see on an airplane; b) they all appeared to hover momentarily in their movement, which planes cannot do; c) despite the fireworks being shot off in the neighborhood, we are both very familiar with helicopter sounds and as I stated previously we could not discern anything sound at all coming from them; d) I don't believe they were drones...being a drone owner myself I have yet to see a commercial product that is capable of carrying a payload heavy enough to emit sparks/flames even once, much less multiple times as was the case with the first object I sighted, and these objects ascended before vanishing rather than landing, and finally; e) there is no possible way they could've been fireworks as the first one followed a path across the sky without descending, and the footage I was able to capture shows I had th! e final object in view for over 1:19 minutes - which no type of firework is capable of sustaining.",2015-07-06T00:00:00,,,

I noticed an odd light off to the north, our line of sight to the Steel Stacks being in an ENE direction.  As I watched, it moved in a slight arc and then a straight line where it slowed and hovered.  I pointed it out to my friend, who acknowledged seeing it, but was more interested in the fireworks display. As I studied the object, I was able to see a central brighter cream-white colored light surrounded by three smaller cream-white lights arranged in an equilateral triangular form about the central light.  Occasionally I was able to see a red line going from one of the outer lights to the central light.  There were no flashing red or green lights, and no noise, although between the professional and amateur fireworks it was hard to hear anything. After hovering for 30 seconds to a minute the object just faded away and disappeared.  It did not fly off or move from its hover position.

We had just passed thru the town of Chester, SC and were about 6 miles south of Chester on Hwy 121. Suddenly, all 3 of us noticed a fireball in the sky with a magnificent long tail for at least 20-30 seconds in duration (until it was out of sight) that was traveling at what seemed to be the speed of an aircraft.  The object was traveling parallel to the ground with possibly a very slight descending projection although it did not appear to be in an emergency situation.  No erratic movements or speed changes like portrayed on UFO sightings were seen.  The object was heading in a northwestward direction.  The altitude although hard to estimate, seemed to be what one would expect from a helicopter flying at its maximum height capability, but again distances can fool you and I cannot verify.  I can state however, that the object was blocked for a few seconds from the tree line.  I was able to get out of the car to observe this phenomenon, but did not hear any noise whatsoever.  The speed was consistent, the path relatively straight.  My daughter did mention that at times she tho! ught she observed pieces following each other, she described much like a train.  My wife and I did not share this description, but she has far better eyes than either of us. Although I am not a meteorologist, this did not resemble a typical meteor burning up in the atmosphere, and it lacked the excessive speed and downward projection of a “falling star”.  It had a consistent path and offered little change in its course or speed. I told my boss about this incident and he related a website from TV Channel 12 in Augusta, Georgia with reportings of it being seen there at the same time as we witnessed this occurrence.  Augusta is about a 2 hour drive from where we saw the event.  Lastly, my wife just reported that witnesses in Charlotte saw the occurrence at 1:30-1:45 (a little later than us) and it is being reported as a Russian satellite.",2015-07-03T00:00:00,34.69309999999998,POINT(-81.25820000000009 34.69309999999998),-81.25820000000009

Where those two highways intersect, there is an area of commerce called the Marq’E. While driving, I saw a glowing light in the sky.  The light was neon-green ish in color and nothing else around it. It was more of an orb; the shape resembled a low-hanging star, but there’s no way a star would appear this low.  It was hard to judge exactly how high up in the sky this orb was, and I wasn’t in the position to stop my vehicle to better gauge its positioning from the highway.   Houston drives are horrible, so, all I could do was stare in awe and wonder.  The orb had a luminous glow around it, as the clear Houston sky that held it, showed some of the green rays permeating from it.  Have you ever been on your back in the grass at night just staring up at the sky and admiring the stars?  This is what this orb reminded me of, star gazing.  I gazed, while avoiding not crashing, almost making eye contact with the light.  And then, just like that in the blink of an eye, the orb shot downward, out of view disappearing.

The object started out as a red light hovering very high in the sky. It stayed in that position for sometime. At this point it did not look suspicious. As we topped a hill, I called this object to the attention of all the members in our car. We stopped at the top and all 7 of us noticed a pulsing red light. It would also show some white pulsing. After about 10 minutes the object jumped across the sky due north. It appeared to travel at an extreme rate of speed. It burned a red light then shot across the sky. It also traveled up, way up to what seemed 40,000 feet or higher, higher than any aircraft we have spotted. It shot back at the same extreme rate of speed. The children were extremely frightened. This action did not seem reasonable for an airplane or any other known aircraft. We watched as it shot straight up and due north, then disappeared. I went outside later that night, the air was crisp and I noticed the lack of wind. I have spotted similar objects in the night sky, without the movement, always on calm nights without clouds or wind. I swear this sighting to be the truth. I am a teacher and would not have believed this had I not seen it with my own eyes.

Visiting potential inlaws (year before marriage)in rural area a very few miles south of Merkel, near Abilene, TX.  After lunch, while family members visited in ranch house, I went checking promising areas along small stream for archeological remains.  Found site with surface artifacts a few hundred yards north and a bit west of house, which itself had surficial artifacts due north.  Site was across road from area north of house, perhaps 300 yards.  After about 30 minutes of exploring, I looked up and saw disc-shaped object almost directly overhead, a little north and east of me.  Note here that surveying surface sites requires intense scrutiny of the ground, and therefore occasional reorientation of the head and neck in order to avoid muscle pain.  I had looked up several times while changing orientation, but sometimes looked east, or west, or NE, etc.  This time it was due north.  Object was moving due north, not especially fast but easily at same speed as a commercial jet.  Shape was perfectly circular, with no visible evidence of thickness --looked to me as if it were an extremely thin disc.  It moved due north at regular speed with no variation at all.  Neve rmoved from course.  Color silver-gray, as if brushed aluminum.  Not shiny or reflective -- gray on bottom, which was obviously in shadow.  No glow, no lights, no features of any kind.  As object continued north, it grew more ""oblong,"" that is, its N-S dimension shrank in relation to its E-W dimension, which did change.  It looked like a dime held at arm's length, but somewhat smaller.  As it went north, it got smaller in both directions, but it never gave any indication of thickness and did, indeed, seem rather thin in relation to its width.  Also did not change color or shade, but did seem to get somewhat darker as it went north.  Object disappeared into some high, fine clouds at a point very far north of me.  Estiamte of speed -- 600 to 1000 mph.  Sound -- none.  Lights -- none.  Colors other than gray -- none.  Movement to sides -- none.  C! hange in altitude -- none.  Change in direction -- none.  Decorations or discernible features: none.  Protuberances -- none.  Shape -- perfectly circular but thin, not spherical.  Upper superstructure -- possible, just not visible.  Lower shape -- unknown; looked flat but could have been either concave or convex; if so, not by much.  Duration of sighting -- about 3 minutes maximum, probably a minute less.  I recall removing my eyes long enough to light a cigarette, look around to see if anyone else was in sight, and returnig my gaze until it disappeared.   No one else around.  Sky -- clear except for very high, very thin, very fine, long feather-shaped clouds in parallel orderly arrangements that some people now seem to think represent ""chemtrails"" or other manipulation of the weather.  Back then, we recognized these cloud features as being normal for summer or late spring.  Object was above these clouds, which according to qualified resources not given to paranoia usually appear in the 30,000 - 36,000 feet elevations.  That means object was higher than 36000 feet and therefore was pretty damned big.  Speed may well have been in excess of 1500 mph.  No other objects in sky.  Nearby to NE was an AFB with a SAC detachment.  No planes scrambled.  Note that the object was perfectly clearly limned or delineated -- edges crisply defined.

Front Royal, Va, has a lot of airplane activity daily and is not uncommon because there is a small airport in the town.  I KNOW the difference!

I am currently back in the DC area and have furthermore verified that what I was seeing was not a manmade craft or hoax.  That town is in the Shenandoah valley and fairly secluded.  It definitely needs to be investigated if only for a week or two.  I assure you that a sighting will be made.  The most disturbing sighting was on a cloudy night as I was on my front porch smoking a cigarette.  A dull metallic object caught my eye as I looked up at the sky as I often did to appreciate the view of the stars.  We don't get a great view here in the city so I made a point every night to enjoy the beauty.  As I looked up, as God be my witness no more than 30 ft directly above my head was a cigar shaped metallic craft gliding completely silent over my head then behind my house.   I rushed cigarette still in hand which is odd because there is no smoking allowed in my home to the back deck to find the object nowhere in sight.  I was petrified to say the least.  Usually I would see multiple orbs of light far up in the sky,but this was literally right above me and absolutely NO NOISE.

What I saw still haunts me to this day. Less than one hundred and fifty feet away, hovering near the top of the neighbors' backyard tree, which towers to 50 to 65 feet in height, was an object that I had never before seen.  My mind seemed to be scrambled for a millisecond in an effort to ""make"" the object identifiable.  I saw the ""ghosts"" of a tail section and large rotor blades on the top, but those projections quickly vanished.  There were lights toward the front, asymmetrically placed on a ""bulkhead"" of sorts, and those lights were not blinking or moving.  The colors were red, green, blue, and a singular white light. The body of this craft at first appeared to follow in a general way the body of a military helicopter, with flat sides that rolled over the top with a similar roll on the bottom.  The exterior was glassy smooth and the color was a bluish-gray, what I first called ""Periwinkle,"" certainly not exactly what I intended to suggest.  It was a Periwinkle blue-gray, but a much darker value than the color that most people understand to be Periwinkle. I am not an illustrator, and so my illustration does not depict the color correctly. In total silence, and as if acknowledging that I had spotted it, the craft quickly moved toward my house and passed directly overhead the window from which I was observing.  From the first moment of its departure, the object appeared to change its shape into a cylindrical ""oil drum"" with two rounded ends, though the leading end was ""notched out"" from about half-way up the cylinder to the top.  That ""notch"" moved back perhaps four or five feet, and then stopped at a vertical bulkhead, upon which the lights were set in recessed openings.  I did not see any pilots. Now the interesting thing is that I continued “seeing” this craft for several hours, as though it had been imbedded in my mind.  Also, there seemed to be a kind of transparent hatch cover that covered the notched out front section of the craft, which I never saw with my eyes.  But it became real and seeable in my memory image as it repeatedly slid open and closed for a very long time.  That action was very fast and it seemed that it was done so many times in order that I understand its importance.  If it actually had any importance, I have failed to realize that. The entire episode must have taken place in about two seconds, which is a very long time when you are seeing something so far removed from normal experiences. That morning I drew some rough sketches of the craft and guessed at measurements and distances, etc., and really goofed on much of that.  It was after I got out a tape measure and started taking actual measurements that I saw how erroneous my first guesses had been.  Now much of that has been corrected, though I still need to figure the height of the roof of the house next door without arousing too much suspicion. My emotional reaction to the sighting:  I felt as though there was a strange violation of my privacy. It was as though I felt that I was being watched and the moment that I discovered that, “they” fled the scene very rapidly.  So overall, I had an ominous feeling, a feeling that is related to paranoia. The following morning, September 30, 2012, I heard the loud thumps of a helicopter approaching my house, so I grabbed my camera and ran outdoors.  The Army helicopter crossed my front yard at an aerial height of no more that 70 feet, and I was able to get two photos of that black machine.  How very curious that such a visit would take place so soon after my sighting.  We rarely see helicopters in this area, aside from the occasional EMT Rescue copter. Eleven months later a photograph taken in Brazil was revealed in “Filer’s Files,” a web news letter about UFO’s.  The object in the photograph was almost identical to the object that I saw.  Since then another similar object was photographed in Pikesville, MD, and shared on the web via “UFO Sightings Hotspots.”",2015-07-03T00:00:00,37.7776,POINT(-76.5136 37.7776),-76.5136

I opened the door and I heard nothing.  No noise.  I watched it fly right over and just in shock a little.   I walked back in and another one started  to come from the same direction.  I ran and woke up my wife who went to sleep with the kids.  She ran down only to see it get out of sight over the tree line.  ((expletive deleted..))  to my surprise, another started to come over again.  This time she ran and grabbed my phone and watched it with me.  My phone wouldn't focus so I gave up and watched it with my own eyes.   My wife also couldn't believe  it.  I have two very short videos of the lights.  It looks fake to me, or just a light in the sky.   Another one started to come over and I ran and got my keys, this time I followed it to the lake so I could see what happened next.  The light went towards Plattsburg, New your ((sic.  New York)).  I could see it going towards where they are shooting fire works off.  It was brighter than the fireworks, I cant understand why its not on the news or all over the internet.  The light was incredible.   My wife said she would have called me crazy if she didn't see it her self.    One last note.  I live in the landing, and take off path for Burlington Vermont airport.  I noticed that no planes landed or took off for hours.  Its never been so quite in the sky.   Later that night, planes started coming over and the normal noise begin,  nothing out of the norm.   Not flares, not skydivers.  If it was an electric engine, it was amazingly quite, and the light was bright.   I woke up and went to the news channel watching to see and nothing.

My boyfriend said that while I was filling out this form it appeared as though a very dim ""shooting star"" came out of the original light.

My parents, now in their 70’s, had, what they think, was a UFO sighting back sometime between August 1967-July 1971 (they are unsure of the exact year).  They do know it was during the summer (July or August).  They lived in Washougal, WA, USA.  It occurred sometime between 10pm-midnight. My parents had gone to bed.  It was a hot summer night (no AC in those days), so the upstairs windows were all open.  My brother and I (infant-toddler age) were in our own beds in our own room.  My father was asleep in bed, my mother awake in the same bed.  All of a sudden, my mom saw a very bright, white light out their second story bedroom window. She got up to look out the window and saw a perfect circle of light, cylindrical-shaped, that filled up the side roof of the next-door neighbor’s house.  Because of the way the neighbor’s house was/is situated, no on else in the neighborhood would have been able to see the shape of the light, only the brightness.  There was no sound at all.  She said the first light lasted a few seconds. She woke my dad up and then the light shone again, for a few seconds as well this second time.  They both saw it and said the light was a very distinct, perfect circle that came from the sky, down into a cylinder-shape onto the roof.  To this day, they bo! th report the exact same thing—a bright, white circle of light that had no “edging or haziness” to it.  It is still very clear in their minds. They both were trying to come up with some plausible explanation for this—an airplane?  A helicopter? But, they said there was not a sound—total silence.  My mom called the Washougal Police Department to report this and see if anyone else had seen this.  The police department said there were no other reports of this or any other kind of aircraft around that night (she said she felt crazy even calling at all, but felt compelled). Now, if you knew my parents, you would understand why they have never talked about this with anyone other than myself.  They are skeptical by nature, don’t necessarily “believe” in UFO’s, are religious, pragmatic, and not prone to “stories.”  When I asked them if I had their permission to report this sighting, they agreed. They also agreed to be interviewed.  They are getting older and I think they figure that if people are going to think they’re “crazy”, then it might as well be now.  Ha!  This is the first time I have written the story out or shared it with anyone.  I don’t know if I am even reporting to the correct agency or not, but here it is.  I don’t know if it’s “too late” or if this is anything of interest to anyone, but I feel that it’s better late than never. Thank you. P.S.--On a crazier side-note, when I was in my late thirties, doctors happened to discover that I only have one kidney.  I went my whole life (and had three healthy pregnancies) without this knowledge.  They said that on the side where there is no kidney, there is a little empty “sack”—“Most likely you were born this way, we don’t know.”  Strange.  I’m sure it’s coincidence and “stolen kidneys” are a complete myth, but it has, on occasion, caused me to say, “Hmmm.” ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My bed headboard abuts a large window allowing me to gaze almost directly upward.  It is common for me to waken about every two hours or so, as I did this night. I saw what at first I thought was a falling star, a dot of light, but it was slower than normal.  After a brief arc it blinked out.  Following the line of sight ahead, I was surprised to see a dark charcoal triangular shape moving along the same line and at the same speed as brief dot of light. In disbelief, I grabbed my glasses and looked again.  Along the same line, I saw the same shadowy dark charcoal triangular shapes against the black sky, one after another, equidistant apart.  I did not count but guess I saw six or seven in a row.  At the end, there was a group of five or six in a symmetrical formation. As these objects passed, background stars were blocked from sight.  There was no sound. I have no idea what to make of it.  I was not dreaming.  Indeed, after searching the sky for a couple more minutes, I turned on the light and with an app on my smart phone took a compass reading of the direction.  A close approximation was a heading of 206 degrees (plus/minus), or south by southwest. Location and Conditions:  I live in Lakebay, Washington, about 2 miles southeast of Key Center, a small community.  It is a wooded setting with no outdoor lights close by.  My house was dark with no lights on.  I am surrounded by high fir trees, distant about 30 feet away from my bedroom window, and about 80 feet away in the direction of the objects.  There is a screen on the window out of which I was looking. Considerations:  Because of the initial observation of light, as a meteor, I have dismissed the thought that this could have been a flock of Canadian geese.  Further, geese are noisy when they fly, constantly honking.  Everything was a tad too symmetrical in any event. Had they been planes or jets, I would have been able to hear them.  It was absolutely silent.  And because what I saw had size and shape, not just specks, planes would have been close enough to easily hear. I cannot speculate on size, distance or speed.  I have no idea what I saw.  But I was awake and did see what I have described, definitely there but very dark.  Again, the objects were a dark slate gray, just barely lighter than the background black night sky, covering stars as they passed by. I am divorced, 65, and live alone. Not an UFO kind of guy, I am not keen on publicity and prefer relative anonymity.

It was approaching at a fairly rapid speed. I can't estimate the elevation but it didn't appear to me to that high. It appeared as large as the moon in the sky. It was quite bright but not painful to look at. The light appeared to look like some kind of plasma or liquid light. Trailing behind were three rings which decreased in size the farther they where from the ufo. The rings were barely perceptible and shimmered. The rings always maintained their their absolute distance from the ball and from one another. I want to stress that these rings were very faint. I barely noticed them. The object itself had a very sharp outline despite being extremely bright. It cat a glow on the water as it passed over the cove. I called to the woman I was staying with (she was in the bathroom) The object was on a trajectory directly over the house and I ran out the front door in time to see it go directly overhead and disappear from view due to the pine trees. There was no sound. My host didn't see it and was quite skeptical. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Around 11:45 pm on Thursday, June 4th.   I wanted to go outside with the dog to cool off.  We walked out the front door of our apt and turned left.  She was sniffing around for somewhere to pee, and I see this super bright light, low in the sky.   The sky was dark, thin veil of clouds, could barely tell they were there.  Lots of stars out.  This light was odd because it seemed to be located near the flight path,  (Sea-Tac is about 15 miles away) and was extremely low-–lower than the planes flying.  It looked like a bright white light and I couldn’t tell if it was moving.   Sometimes I get self conscious watching the sky because I can imagine what people think of me always watching the sky at night.  My neighbors had their parents in their 5th wheel near where I was standing.   I decided to get my binoculars out of the car and hoped I could see from there so that the neighbor’s parents couldn’t see me.  I could not see anything from the car so walked back to where I had been.  At first, the light looked like one bright white light but as I watched it, it changed to a fiery orange.  That’s when I noticed that it was moving very slowly.  I could tell because there is a row of decorative tall trees at the barrier of the apts and the mobile home park.   The light was above the trees in the beginning but it moved to the left, then lowered a little so it was below the treetops and then moved to the right about 2 trees over.  Once it cleared treetops again, it got very orange and at one point, through the binoculars, it looked almost like two headlights.  Problem is, I think the kids dropped my binoculars because it looks like double vision so not sure if what I seen was really how it looked.  What was odd is that normally when I look through them, if I’m trying to zone in on a single light/star in the night sky these days; it looks like two but far apart.  This light looked like two orange headlights close together, really close together.  It kept moving to the right now and it moved back to the left one more time and t! hen must have moved away from my sight beyond the trees because I never saw it come out either side or up over the trees again.   This whole time, the dog was lying down in the grass and her rope was lying near my feet. Suddenly, a cat walked in front of us and the dog lunged to chase it and I nearly fell.  I decided to go in at that time which was about 12:10pm.  This sighting lasted probably 10 to 15 minutes.   It seems that somebody in our town had to have seen this.  I am thinking it was clearly visible near Sumner/Milton border. Many years ago when I lived on Wood Avenue, I had a most amazing sighting – the brightness of that light reminded me of this one as well as how low it was. That sighting lasted about 2 hours and it changed to green, blue and a most beautiful teal color. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Yes, Thursday, June 4th - sorry.

On June 6, 2015, at 10:00 PM, in Arlington, WA, I got out of my car to pump some gas at the Safeway gas pumps in Smokey Point.  As I turned north to walk behind my car, I saw several orange lights jump up into the sky very quickly, one after another.  Each one popped up within a second or less after the one before it.  I have photos of ten of them, but I think there was an 11th one that is not in the photo.  It seemed like there was a straggler. They stayed somewhat low above the horizon for about 30 seconds.  (You can get a good idea of this in the photos.)  I took a total of ten photos while they were in sight.  Then they suddenly turned to the east, (they had been heading south towards me, and I was slightly to the west of them) and flew out of sight pretty quickly.  There was no sound from them the entire time. These lights were much brighter and bigger than any star and much smaller than the Moon. You can get a sense of this in the photos.  I did not see any flashing lights, just steady, orange lights moving across the sky.  They did not have any of the lights that a typical airplane would have. I did consider the possibility that they could be Chinese lanterns.  However, they moved much too quickly and with too much control for that to be the case.  In my location, I wondered if they had taken off from the Arlington Airport, which is not a manned airport (it has automated landing).  That could have been approximately where they took off from, because they looked reasonably close.  However, they could also have taken off further north than that.  The lights were bright enough to be seen from a good distance. There was not a noticeable wind in the area at the time I saw this.  I think Chinese lanterns would have stayed around much longer, even if there had been a strong wind. When I expand the one photo of three lights, I can see the orange glow.  It’s not real clear.  I took the photos with my iPhone. However, you can get a sense of the color.

We live in an area called Union Hill which is 500 feet above sea level and is a hill top above the small city of Redmond, Washington.   We were almost home, a neighborhood with most homes on one acre plots. I was watching out the passenger side window of the car when I saw a large firework explode.  Beside it I saw an immensely, intense glowing orange light, spherical shape, almost like a fireball.  I told my husband to immediately stop the car and back-up.  He did and I jumped out of the car and clearly saw a bright, bright, bright orange ball.  They were off toward the eastern sky, not too far off as they appeared in the same proximity of where I had just seen the firework explode.  (They were not directly overhead.)  Followed close behind was a second orange sphere, identical to the first, and! following the driving line of the first ball.  Then, trailing just slightly further behind, was a third sphere.  All identical in color. The most unbelievable, intense glowing orange I have ever seen.   My husband was on the driver side and keep telling me to take  picture.  I wanted to but just felt that if I moved my eyes the objects would be gone before I could figure out how to get a photo.  I watched for maybe 30 seconds.  All three looked like they were glowing hot.  Once they passed us I could still see them flying but they no longer glowed.  I could see almost like an outline of the ball, faintly defined.

On the evening of July 4th at around 11:30 P.M.  My wife and I were standing on our deck in our back yard watching the neighbors firework displays.  I looked to the east, through the trees and saw what appeared to be a solid orange light moving in a south, southwest direction at a speed relatively close to an to a commercial jet. A couple of months ago I made a report to this site about a triangular object with an exceptionally bright solid white light.  As that object moved to the south and disappeared, the light turned to an orange and the object disappeared.  The orange light on this craft was exactly like the light of the triangular craft from my first report. I realized it was something different when I noticed that it had no blinking lights and was definitely not part of a fireworks display.  I quickly pointed it out to my wife and she was somewhat baffled as to what it could be.  She only caught a short view, maybe 5-10 seconds before it disappeared behind the trees.  I ran into the house, grabbed the binoculars from the table and ran out the front door to pick up it's trajectory.   Once outside, I immediately, picked up the object but just as I put the binoculars on it, it disappeared completely. I lowered the binoculars to see if I could see it with a wider field of view and I spotted a second light of the exact same type, coming out from behind the trees and following the same course as the original, but it appeared to be further in the distance as it looked somewhat smaller. I started to raise the binoculars again and this light also disappeared. I scanned the area just the same and one thing stood out, the sky was completely cl! ear where both objects disappeared and the stars in the background were completely visible, there was no obstruction to block my view of either object.  The whole incident probably lasted right at or under one minute. These two objects were coming from the northeast and they disappeared very near to where I lost sight of the first object back in April. As with the first sighting, these objects made no sound. When I asked my wife what she thought, she said that they looked similar to lights on an airplane but she agreed that it was weird that they wouldn't have any blinking lights or that their lights would be orange. It's possible that rising smoke from all of the fireworks could have given them an orange hue but about ten minutes later a commercial jetliner crossed the path that they had taken and it looked white with two blinking lights. It was very clear that the lights that we saw were completely different. The lights, even in orange looked exceptionally bright.  I stated in my first report that we live near joint base Lewis/McChord and we've seen plenty of military traffic go over our home. This was nothing like anything we've seen. I scanned some other reports from our general location and noticed that I'm not the only one who has described similar objects. Just wondering if they could be testing something at the base? This base isn't normally known for that I kind of activity but I have a limited knowledge of what they do there on the Air Force side.  The sky was clear, no wind and just for the record, I don't drink, do drugs or take medication of any kind.  I'm not saying that these things are extra terrestrial, most things have a logical explanation, but this one has me stumped.  If you have any suggestions I would be open to hear them. Until then I guess I'll keep looking in that area to see if this happens regularly.  One last question regarding the lights. If there was no obstruction in my view, which there was not, I have never heard of an aircraft, much less two, that suddenly turn off all of their exterior lights when flying at night. If it were a plane, why would they do that?",2015-07-06T00:00:00,47.14574063670391,POINT(-122.29242022471965 47.14574063670391),-122.29242022471965

Two of the persons who witnessed this are former military veterans, with 18 years of service between them.  When I asked them what they thought it was, they could not identify the object.   The UFO was flying from the south heading north. It was a triangular shape of gold to light yellow light and it had three black dots that were at the back of the light shape.  As it traveled across the sky it became hazy and turned into a cloud.  It was by far the strangest thing I have ever seen in the night sky.   From the time that I first saw the object to when it changed to a cloud was about 20 seconds.  It seemed longer, but in reality it was not very long at all.  Then we watched the “cloud” move out of our view for about another 15 seconds.   It never entered my mind to try and video record it because we were all staring at it trying to figure out what it was.  My conclusion is a flying object with some kind of cloud cloaking device?  The time was between 1030 and 11pm.   One of the reasons I noticed this object is because I was looking up at the sky as the first part of the aurora borealis started.  This object did not move in any way, shape or form like the lights that were from the aurora borealis.  This sighting happened at Lake Arbutus, WI.  I did this little sketch to give you an idea of what I saw before it turned into a cloud.  And this is about the same size that it looked like up in the sky.

Object was first glimpsed while flying past a window that is approximately 11'-6"" high off the finished floor. The object appeared to be an orange/red sphere, about the size of a risen full moon, and appeared to be flying just above the tree tops. After spotting it in the window, I ran out onto the deck and watched it fly over head and then behind the trees to the south, headed in the direction of Baileys Harbor.  As it moved south, I could still see its glow but could no longer see the sphere. It was probably visible to me between 30 seconds to a minute.

I live in a suburb of Milwaukee where there is a lot of families, schools, churches, shopping malls, etc.  This first event happened in late May or early June of 2011. It was about 9pm and I decided I would go out for a late evening walk, since the weather was nice.  I get about 2 or 3 blocks from home when I hear a peculiar sound.  I stood there at the corner of the street listing to this.  It clearly from the sky, but I couldn't tell which direction.  What struck me odd was that this was unlike anything I heard before.  The sound didn't sound like traffic, or weather, or airplanes, or factories, etc. In fact, it sounded like something from a horror movie!  I looked up and down the street if anyone was out to hear what I was hearing, but everyone was inside.  Nonetheless, this sound made my hair stand on end, it was really unner! ving. I decided to end my walk early and head back home.  After about a week or two I forgot about the incident until late in the year I heard some people talk about this on the radio.  People the world over had been experiencing these sky sounds and even some has posted videos of it on You Tube.  It's a real deal, and it's very ominous sounding.

I would sit there, facing west, around 5pm, sometimes for a couple hours.   Anyhow, as I'm looking at the afternoon sky, and it was still bright and sunny out, I noticed a very bright light, low in the sky, close to the horizon.  Day after day it was there.  On first blush, I though it was a very bright star- but at 5pm in the afternoon?!  The moon wasn't even out!   As I had the habit of coming out to watch it, it would bob slowly off in the horizon, to the point that it would slowly move down, out of view, (the trees were blocking it from view).  This happened over the course of months. Now as this was going on, I noticed that when after it rained, craft slowly flying through the clouds, slowly lighting up really bright, then dimming.  But they stayed in the clouds.  I could barely make the shape of the craft.  There was several of these craft at any given time (after a rain storm).

Report#3-  This encompasses the year of 2013. 1) Spring 2013 (approx May 19th or so), evening:  I was walking home from the library and it was evening, about 7pm. It was getting dark.  As I'm about a few blocks from home, I noticed a really bright light in the northern sky. I initially thought it was a plane and dismissed it as being so, although it was still somewhat peculiar.  Around 11pm, as I'm taking trash out to the dumpster and settling in for the night, that really bright light was still there! I had to get a good look at it.  So I walked to the local softball field where I always have been able to get a good view at the night sky.  As I'm walking there while looking at the light, it was not 'twinkling' as a star does, but pulsating.  And every time it 'blinked' it changed color-blue, red, green, yellow, white, and so forth.  I finally got to my location and I stood there for 45 minutes watching it pulsate.  It was bigger and brighter than any star I've ever seen.  I can't tell if it was out in space or 'local' to my are! a.  At one moment, there was a bright blue flash directly below it.  Unfortunately, I could see the horizon since trees and houses blocked the view. I would've stayed out all night to watch it, but I had to go to work in the morning.  Incidentally, it was gone the next night. 2)  Bright, large light in the western sky that would move slowly down.  It didn't twinkly so much as it would pulsate.  It would appear in the blue of sky and would get brighter the darker it got.  It would move slowly, down, diagonally, out of view after two hours.  I experienced this all year in 2013 and it disappeared in early 2014.  IT'S NOT VENUS, nor is it a satellite or space station, I'm certain of that.  It has reappeared in 2015, but it is not as bright or as large, but it still moves.  I've also seen it do some strange things.  In 2013, as I'm sitting out there waiting for it appear, a white orb that sort of blended in the bright blue afternoon sky, flew from the east, over my head, and take its place in the western sky.  It was the same thing, because it would slowly light up the darker the sky got.  I've also seen it move at an alarming speed and come to a dead stop at it's spot in the western afternoon sky. 3)  One day in 2013, summer, I was walking down the avenue to the store, this was around noon, and I happened to look up in the sky (for no particular reason) and noticed white orbs flying in and out the clouds. I stood there several minutes watching this. When I came back from the store, they were gone. 4)  This was big one for me.  It was Friday before Labor Day 2013.  It was around 8pm and it was getting dark. I went out to my usual spot to watch the sky.  I initially didn't see anything out of the ordinary, and the bright western light had already disappeared. After 15 minutes or so, I thought I'd head back home, since it was hot and muggy. After walking about a block from my spot, I look over my should an see something truly out of the ordinary. A string of red/orange orbs appeared low in the sky and moved up, in a diagonal direction. Occasionally, the orbs would make 'shapes' as they flew up in the sky.  Anyhow, they'd reach their position in the sky and blink (or 'pop') out.  After each one would pop, there would be a dull purple sparkling effect that would fly off in the opposite direction.  This all happened over 15 minutes or so and was completely silent.  At one moment as I'm watching this, a helicopter flew over my head directly towards the orbs but I couldn't see if any! thing happened since trees and houses blocked the view.  I called the police department to ask if anyone else saw what I so and I was told no. However, the next day, I scoured the internet, and some people in Illinois, Ohio, and even Egypt saw the very thing I saw on the same day and about the same time. In fact, videos of these orbs can be found on You Tube. Anyhow, I came out the next day to see if they'd reappear. Nothing happened like the night before- HOWEVER that Saturday night, as I'm sitting there waiting for something to happen, a sound from the sky returned and it got real loud (it seemed like it was right above me)- but this time it sounded like white noise. The duration of this was maybe five minutes. As I'm looking at the sky for the source of this sound, I latched on to one red/orange in the southern sky. As the sound ended abruptly, this red/orange orb blinked out at the same time.  Like I said, something strange is going on. 2013 was a big year for me on experiencing these things. These sky sounds are real, and I'm convinced it's not HAARP but something paranormal in origin. And I think these orbs are linked to these sounds.  But these are real things and not a hoax. 2014 was a quiet year and I didn't experience anything too out of the ordinary. But 2015 seems that things might be ramping up again. The western 'star' is back. I've been seeing strange lights slowly light up and die out low in the horizon.  I never in my life thought I'd see a UFO, let alone nearly in my own back yard. Plus I'm experiencing these things on a regular basis (though it seemed to peak in 2013) and still experienced a shape-shifting bronze object on 7/2/2015 late morning and in the bright blue of sky.  Something really odd is going on. More people need to keep their eyes on the sky, because they'd probably see this stuff as easily as I have been. I don't know what it means. But I'm thoroughly convinced it's something paranormal in original, maybe even supernatural. And I'm confident airline pilots are seeing these things left and right. And I KNOW the government is aware of this stuff, certainly the things I'm seeing and hearing 2011-2015. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
